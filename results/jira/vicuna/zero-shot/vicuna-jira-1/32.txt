A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from Jira as either (1) positive or (2) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Sorry ;-)


ASSISTANT: The sentiment in the sentence "Sorry ;-)" is neutral. The use of the emoticon with the sentence suggests that the person is trying to convey an apologetic tone, but the actual words "Sorry" do not contain enough information to determine the sentiment as either positive or negative.
