USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from GitHub, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Can this be handled in the actual database adapters? I.e. by putting PG specific code in the PG adapter.  Maybe by adding e.g. a `:fixed_string` entry to the `native_database_types` hash, and using `""fixed_#{type}"".to_sym` if fixed is true."
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: neutral
