A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from GitHub, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: If you add `TODO:` in the comment, many code editors will show it in an overview. Might be useful, and more clear to readers that it isn't just commented out code (otherwise, someone that doesn't know might remove it)."
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: positive
