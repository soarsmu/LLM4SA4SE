A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from GitHub. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: We can only compare our results to json.parse on browser that have the native method. I agree it's not optimal to test this everywhere but where we actually use it. Perhaps we dump this test's attempt to compare since we don't care about the native result."
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: (2) Neutral
