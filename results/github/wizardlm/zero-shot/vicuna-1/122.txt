A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from GitHub as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Shouldn't this always be `""1.0""`?  The rest of the `tornado.auth` code is pretty much hardwired to handle either version 1.0 or 1.0a, and if we always need to send 1.0 in the 1.0a case, all cases are covered.  This also makes the `_oauth_version_to_send()"
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in the given sentence is (1) positive. 

The speaker is suggesting a solution to a problem in the `tornado.auth` code. They propose that instead of handling two different versions (1.0 and 1.0a), the code should always send 1.0. This way, all cases are covered, and the function `_oauth_version_to_send()` will be simplified. The speaker seems to think that this solution is a good idea because it makes the code more efficient and easier to manage.
