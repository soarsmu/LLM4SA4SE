ASSISTANT: To categorize the sentiment in the given sentence, I will follow these steps:

1. Read and understand the sentence: The sentence is about an APC driver and a comment mentioning memcache.

2. Identify the key words and phrases: APC driver, comment, memcache

3. Analyze the context: The sentence seems to be asking about the discrepancy between the APC driver and a comment mentioning memcache.

Based on the above analysis, I would categorize the sentiment as (2) neutral. The sentence does not express any strong positive or negative emotions. It simply presents a situation where there seems to be a confusion or discrepancy between two things (the APC driver and the comment about memcache).
