USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from GitHub, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: sorry. I fucked up because I had used `git versions python` and wanted to reproduce an older issue with 2.7.3"
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Turns out IE6 leaves a 1px faint trace of the text because `color:transparent` isn't supported by IE6/7/8 (but IE7/8 hide the text properly anyway). So if you to 100% remove any trace of text in IE6, you might have to throw an IE6 hack in there."

ASSISTANT: neutral
