A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from GitHub, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Yup, see what you mean... lol didn't even notice that ;)"
Label: positive
Example Sentence: I hate them too. Anyway, please add urlencode or rawurlencode in _writeUrl(). If you decode it, you must encode it again."
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I disagree. Passing ""::somestring"" would be invalid either way and the developers fault (you cant possibly cover all mistakes possible here). But using the type safe check we would at least result in a meaningful exception: ""trigger_error(__d('cake_dev'
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Glad I could help! :-)"
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
