Label: negative
Example Sentence: Won't happen again :)"

Example Sentence: @Afforess that's a nice food for thought, thank you very much!"

USER: Sentence: The whole point behind previously removing this line was that there's no point behind assigning this variable to the value of one that already exists. :) So, it should be better to update line 191 to:      $uri = substr($_SERVER['REQUEST_URI'], strlen($_S"
