USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from GitHub, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Shouldn't this always be `""1.0""`?  The rest of the `tornado.auth` code is pretty much hardwired to handle either version 1.0 or 1.0a, and if we always need to send 1.0 in the 1.0a case, all cases are covered.  This also makes the `_oauth_version_to_send()"
ASSISTANT: The sentiment of this sentence is neutral.
