USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from GitHub as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Haha, come on, you can declare the `git_tree` here instead of doing this."
ASSISTANT: Based on the sentence you provided, I would categorize the sentiment as (2) neutral. The sentence appears to be a suggestion or comment on a code snippet, and the tone is casual and lighthearted, with the use of "Haha" indicating a playful or humorous tone. However, the sentiment is not particularly positive or negative, as it is simply offering an alternative way to write the code.
