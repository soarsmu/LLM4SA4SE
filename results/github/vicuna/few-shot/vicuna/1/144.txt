A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from GitHub, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: `prefix` is the formula's own prefix, and libiconv and gettext aren't linked into `HOMEBREW_PREFIX`, either. It would need to be `#{Formula.factory('libiconv').prefix}`, etc, since libiconv and gettext are keg-only brews."
Label: neutral
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: you should not change the signature of the protected method as this is a BC break. Do the call to ``$request->getRequestFormat()`` in the calling method"
Label:
ASSISTANT: negative
