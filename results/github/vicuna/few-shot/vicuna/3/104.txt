A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from GitHub, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Thanks, been waiting a while for this. :)  Does this support different colors or is that not possible with the client? "
Label: positive
Example Sentence: Maybe a note would be suffiecient, which tells the user to checkout the branch in the latest stable version?"
Label: neutral
Example Sentence: But even without space reuse this is wrong because there's space on both sides. The naive algorithm would be `images.inject(0) {|sum, img| sum + img.width + 2 * img.spacing}`. Also, do we need spacing on the edges? I don't think so."
Label: neutral
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Beloved Rails contributors, could any of you temporarily pluginize this? :)"
