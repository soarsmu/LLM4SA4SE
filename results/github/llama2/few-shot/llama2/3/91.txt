Sentence: How about keeping the duck typing, but simply blacklist `String` instances? `respond_to?(:each) && !is_a?(String)` kinda thing."
Label:
[/INST]
Positive.

Your suggestion to blacklist `String` instances while keeping the duck typing approach is a good compromise between flexibility and safety. By using `respond_to?(:each)` to check if the object has an `each` method, you can ensure that only objects that support the `each` method are allowed to pass the test, while avoiding the potential issues that can arise from allowing `String` instances to pass the test.
