Sentence: This promise juggling seems quite brittle, whose responsibility is it to complete it? Is it safe to call the exception-throwing ``success`` |Â ``failure`` | ``complete`` methods etc.  How about having ``setMode`` return a Future[Boolean] instead, and doi"
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Neutral

The sentence expresses a concern about the brittleness of the promise juggling mechanism and seeks clarification on the responsibility for completing it. The author also suggests an alternative approach where the `setMode` method returns a future instead of throwing exceptions. Overall, the tone is inquisitive and exploratory, rather than negative or positive.
