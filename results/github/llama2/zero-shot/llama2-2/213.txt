Sentence: say please how you get this data? from sniff?"
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Neutral

The word "sniff" could potentially have a negative connotation, but in this context, it is likely being used as a colloquialism to refer to the process of collecting data. The user is asking how the AI assistant obtained the data, and the neutral tone suggests that they are simply seeking information rather than expressing any negative sentiment.
