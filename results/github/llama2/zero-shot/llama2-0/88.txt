Sentence: regex abuse.  just do: `process.platform.match === ""win32""`  also excessive parens"
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Negative

The sentiment of the sentence is negative because it criticizes the use of excessive parentheses and the `process.platform.match` method to check for the Windows platform. The tone is somewhat sarcastic and suggests that the code is not necessary or well-written.
