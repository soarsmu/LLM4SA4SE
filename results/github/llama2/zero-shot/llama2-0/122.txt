</s><s>[INST]
Sentence: Shouldn't this always be `""1.0""`?  The rest of the `tornado.auth` code is pretty much hardwired to handle either version 1.0 or 1.0a, and if we always need to send 1.0 in the 1.0a case, all cases are covered.  This also makes the `_oauth_version_to_send()"
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Neutral

The sentence expresses a suggestion to always use the version number `"1.0"` in the `tornado.auth` code, regardless of whether the version is 1.0 or 1.0a. The author argues that this will ensure that all cases are covered and simplify the code. The tone is practical and matter-of-fact, with no apparent emotional bias or opinion.
