Sentence: @fxn, what's the point of converting that module to `ActiveSupport::Concern`? There are still no instance methods there, so it's quite logical for the module to be an extension, not inclusion."
Label:
[/INST]  Based on the given sentence, I would assign the sentiment label as "neutral". The speaker is questioning the purpose of converting a module to `ActiveSupport::Concern` and pointing out that there are no instance methods in the module, which suggests a logical reasoning and a lack of strong emotions. The tone is informative and constructive, rather than negative or positive.
