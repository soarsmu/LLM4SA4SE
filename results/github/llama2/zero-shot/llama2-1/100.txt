Sentence: Why should we then even trigger the SEND_HEADERS event? We can also register a listener on MVCs EVENT_FINISH and forget about SEND_HEADERS event. You can also remove there unneeded/ unwished headers."
Label:
[/INST]  Based on the sentence you provided, I would categorize the sentiment as (2) neutral.

The speaker is questioning the purpose of triggering the `SEND_HEADERS` event and suggests that registering a listener on the `EVENT_FINISH` event may be a more appropriate approach. The tone is matter-of-fact and objective, without any apparent positive or negative emotions.
