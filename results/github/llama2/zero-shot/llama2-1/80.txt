Sentence: Turns out IE6 leaves a 1px faint trace of the text because `color:transparent` isn't supported by IE6/7/8 (but IE7/8 hide the text properly anyway). So if you to 100% remove any trace of text in IE6, you might have to throw an IE6 hack in there."
Label:
[/INST]  Sure! Based on the sentence you provided, I would categorize the sentiment as:

(3) Negative.

The sentence mentions that IE6 has a bug that leaves a faint trace of text, and that there is no proper way to completely remove the text in IE6. This implies that IE6 has a negative impact on the functionality of the code, and that a "hack" is needed to work around the issue.
