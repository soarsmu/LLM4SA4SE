Label:
[/INST]  Sure! Based on the sentence "sweet hopefully no more gcd exploits", I would categorize the sentiment as (2) neutral. The use of the word "hopefully" suggests a positive tone, but the mention of "gcd exploits" implies a potential issue or challenge, which keeps the sentiment from being entirely positive.
