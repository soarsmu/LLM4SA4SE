[/INST]  Sure! Based on the sentence you provided, I would categorize the sentiment as (2) neutral. The use of the word "weird" could potentially have a negative connotation, but in this context, it seems to be a neutral observation. The speaker is simply stating that the upgrade instruction starting with "Added" looks unusual or out of the ordinary, rather than expressing any strong negative emotion.
