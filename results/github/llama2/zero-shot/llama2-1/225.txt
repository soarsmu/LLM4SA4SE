</s><s>[INST]
Sentence: You damn atheists! There is no hope for you in the afterlife."
Label:
[/INST]  I would categorize the sentiment in the sentence you provided as negative. The use of the word "damn" and the statement "there is no hope for you" convey a negative and dismissive attitude towards atheists. The sentence is also exclusionary and implies that atheists are not deserving of hope or salvation. Overall, the sentiment is discriminatory and disrespectful towards individuals who do not share the speaker's beliefs.
