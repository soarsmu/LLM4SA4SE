USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from APP reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: good app this app is excellent.....
Label: positive
Example Sentence: very fun!! worth the memory.   :-d
Label: positive
Example Sentence: holy crap i lack the words to describe just how amazing this is on 4.1+. seriously  i've tried to explain it to people who haven't used it  and i just can't. i fail as an orator.  pretty pointless on older android versions though. although i have to wonder what the typical 1 star trolls are going on about battery use. the amount of my battery this uses is almost nonexistent. and complaining that an optional opt-in feature is running in the background when its entire purpose is to run in the background is just stupid.
Label: positive
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: ? this is funny but creepy at the same time
