ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: great app but not perfect if i were reviewing comixology the service  i'd give it five stars. however  this is for the android app  and for that  i can only give it three.  i'd used the ipad app  with it's great "hd" support  which is lacking on some android tablets.  that's not a major issue  but the biggest drawback to the app is the lack of sd support.  a majority of tablets have the option for sd cards  expanding their storage space  and many apps can take advantage of it.  it's a shame comixology's app hasn't been able to do this yet.  i don't know if it's concerns over security  if someone could take the books on the card and copy them elsewhere  but seriously  it's easy enough to copy files from system memory if you look it up.  give users the option to save to sd cards and this review will jump to five stars.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is (2) neutral. The user has mixed feelings about the app. They appreciate its features and would rate it highly if it were for a different service, but they are disappointed with the lack of SD card support on the Android app. They suggest that this feature would improve their rating.
