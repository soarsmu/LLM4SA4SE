Example Sentence: not so grand the features are great if they work  which unfortunately is nearly never. constantly loses connection to the server when i'm on stable wifi  crashes continuously  doesn't keep up the stream to chat and doesn't like to load lootables at all. this app hasn't been updated in over a year and it's easy to see the lack of support.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: best for me best for me
Label: positive
Example Sentence: great apps works well and looks great. lots of available providers. from the 5 or so apps i've tested  deliveries seems to support the most.  i submitted a bug report when statuses from one of the providers wasn't working as expected. the developer promptly got back to me and fixed the issue.   only feature i would like is auto-detection of provider based on the tracking number. but as a fellow programmer i understand the challenges presented by such a feature  so this doesn't affect my rating.
Label: positive
Example Sentence: ? ok  preferred the last version but this is ok.
