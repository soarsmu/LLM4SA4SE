Example Sentence: if only... i'm using this app on a note 10.1 and have also tried the obvious competition.   there are some features i really like and already miss in other apps  especially the very well implemented blending and the in-depth controls for setting pressure sensitivity. the deal breaker for me  at the moment: noticeably worse brush lag than in other apps. note: there is actually a "note mode" which limits the area to the current tile and is much smoother  but offers only a small selection of tools while active. i'd love to have that kind of performance with the full functionality (within reason when it comes to more demanding / bigger brushes).  short version: love nearly everything about it and will definitely buy the full version when the performance gets improved.
