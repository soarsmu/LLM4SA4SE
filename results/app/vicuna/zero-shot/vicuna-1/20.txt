USER: Sentence: great app but not perfect if i were reviewing comixology the service  i'd give it five stars. however  this is for the android app  and for that  i can only give it three.  i'd used the ipad app  with it's great "hd" support  which is lacking on some android tablets.  that's not a major issue  but the biggest drawback to the app is the lack of sd support.  a majority of tablets have the option for sd cards  expanding their storage space  and many apps can take advantage of it.  it's a shame comixology's app hasn't been able to do this yet.  i don't know if it's concerns over security  if someone could take the books on the card and copy them elsewhere  but seriously  it's easy enough to copy files from system memory if you look it up.  give users the option to save to sd cards and this review will jump to five stars.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral. The reviewer is giving a positive rating to the Comixology service, but is giving a lower rating to the Android app due to its lack of support for SD cards. The reviewer mentions that this is a major drawback and wishes that the app had this feature. However, the reviewer also acknowledges that the lack of SD support may be due to concerns over security. Overall, the reviewer is expressing a desire for the app to improve in order to receive a higher rating.
