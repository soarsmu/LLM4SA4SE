A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from APP reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: what? how do you change guns?
ASSISTANT: Based on the sentence provided, it is difficult to determine the sentiment expressed in the review. The sentence appears to be a question seeking clarification on how to use a feature in the app, rather than an expression of sentiment.

If you could provide a full review or additional context, I would be happy to help categorize the sentiment expressed.
