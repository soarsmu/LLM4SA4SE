A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from APP reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: ? this is funny but creepy at the same time
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is (2) neutral. The word "but" indicates a contrast between two opposing feelings, which suggests that the reviewer is ambivalent about the app. The word "funny" suggests a positive sentiment, while the word "creepy" suggests a negative sentiment. However, since the reviewer used the word "but" to connect the two feelings, the overall sentiment is neutral.
