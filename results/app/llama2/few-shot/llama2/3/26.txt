Example Sentence: a beautiful and efficient app with one glaringly annoying flaw... this is what got me to a smartphone in the first place  and it remains the best of the best. i miss the labs features  but i like the current incarnation. thanks for putting the scale bar back in but why does it disappear? a map (especially one that zooms and pans) needs a scale bar. keep it visible and i can give you back that 5th star.
Label: neutral
Example Sentence: great app and great books i love the black background feature and the idea of free books is really awesome....
Label: positive
Example Sentence: too slow. app is slower than mobile site and/or competing livejournal apps  like"eljay" (search the marketplace for it). what with the lack of features even in the main pc site  it's proof that livejournal is no match for even the much maligned facebook...rip livejournal.
