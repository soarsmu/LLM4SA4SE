Example Sentence: excellent app for galaxy s4 the major lack (to me) on my gs4 is that the home screen will not rotate to landscape mode. this app resolves the problem.  i have a feature request: the app has to be manually started each time the phone restarts  then the setting has to be selected  then the "close" button selected.   an autostart option with a selectable default mode would make this the ideal app.
