Sentence: ? love. it. works superb i record all calls and just delete ones of no interest or with no verbal data. ps.. got a terrible memory
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Positive

The sentence expresses a positive sentiment towards the product, as the user mentions that they "love" it and that it "works superb." The fact that they record all calls and delete ones of no interest or with no verbal data suggests that they find the product useful and effective. The postscript about having a terrible memory does not detract from the overall positive tone of the sentence.
