A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: here the indentation is wrong ;-)

However, the main question is if the assignments should be aligned in a line or if a single space would be enough indentation...
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Problem is the floating image in license stops the bottom margin working. I've added in a cb div and added some margin top to the feedback box
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Please remove this log, it's a part of the if below
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Either we have MetaDataUpdate that is batch-oriented or we don't. It doesn't make any sense to change the batch behavior for the same instance after it was created. Ever. So, drop that setter and add second assisted inject constructor that accepts BatchRefUpdate parameter instead (and make the batch field final as pointed out above).
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Hrm, I'm not sure how best to handle this.  StackOverflow has a 'Display Name' attribute, does anything similar exist for LDAP & OpenID?

I'd prefer to just show the firstname to save on space.  If we end up showing the full name, I wonder if we could put the name to the left of the search bar and have the search bar expand over it when active, to save on horizontal space.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: The word "Selected" should be capitalized. I'm unsure of the use of "Area" here, BTW. Maybe "Cut Selection"?
