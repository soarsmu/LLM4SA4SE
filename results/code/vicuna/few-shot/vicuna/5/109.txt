A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Yes, assuming the modelService works :)  This private method does not rely on other services.  Also, model service may have issues with elements that have the same ID.  In theory I could put the same element with the same id multiple times in a menu.  I don't know if modelService would be able to resolve that.  At least here we can count and validate if need be.

I will make the other changes and await response on this.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Changed from heap to stack based allocation, will now only allocate enough to hold idmap header.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: action == 0 is Press and action==1 is SetFocus
Do you plan to move this to QAccessibleWidget??
I guess that makes sense
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Hi Nigel,

To expand on what Tobias said, when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name. Otherwise the Launchpad translation site isn't smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it. See https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Developer_Area/Language_strings#Let_translators_know_when_lang_strings_change

So please change the string name to "editaccesspagedescription4". You'll also need to change the name of the string in the PHP files and templates where it is used.

Sorry about that!

Cheers,
Aaron
