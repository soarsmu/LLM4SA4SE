USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.

Example Sentence: Anything that needs to run in the UI thread needs to be wrapped this way, otherwise the IDE complains. It is in the UI testing doc I sent you: https://docs.google.com/a/google.com/document/d/1UBVjIEYXoNVZeYT1NKjqPhCYSkU-X2lWVCrFHbXnPnM/edit?usp=sharing
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: aChild is a ONDXPagePtr which is derived from  SV_DECL_REF(ONDXPage) which has an "ONDXPage & operator*()"

Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Shift + left click or drag to extend T1 of a current range always changes T1 to T2 (and T2 to T1)
