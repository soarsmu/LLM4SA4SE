  }

Example Sentence: Either you don't need these brackets, or you need brackets above where you do:

Can you make the two consistent?
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I'm not really liking this name, maybe just 'Resources'?
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I'll add a comment. 
I don't think #ifdef is a good idea. It makes bugs more likely because you have more code and that code is less tested (because only one version is only compiled and run on any one system).  But I will include the non-workaround version in the comment.
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
