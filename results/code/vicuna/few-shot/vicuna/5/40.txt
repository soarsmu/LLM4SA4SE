A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Element. This one stuck out. I think the only ones to try to capitalize are "Allocation, Type, Element", since that trio is the dominant set of APIs for interacting with any sort of data from Java.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I could put the finalizeForCommandLine after processExceptionAtExit. Then it doesn't change anything for LIB_MPI and that wouldn't work anyhow as you point out.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: It seems to me that the above helpers would be better suited in a different file to keep this file a purely generator one. Does that make sense? is there any good reason to keep it here?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: what happens if this fails? You have already deleted at the backend...
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I don't like either style. Don't like c here. I can change it if it helps to get this pulled.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I will update the currently commented font.family in another change. I will need to add the font first.
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
