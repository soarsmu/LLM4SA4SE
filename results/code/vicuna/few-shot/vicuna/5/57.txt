A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: There is more information https://code.google.com/p/address-sanitizer/wiki/AddressSanitizer#ulimit_-v about alternative
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: i'm confused why this changes the string you fputs but not the 'fn'?
Label: negative
Example Sentence: We also need to check the return value from wal_commit as well.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf.

I agree the name is not great - we can change it if you like. But the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use, so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: You might even want to change (de)allocations in this source to use gf_*() routines (as a part of this patch or separately).
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Sorry but I didn't get why we need 199 here - to trigger some update to 200 afterwards? What if we just fix the update for afterwards then?!?
Label:
ASSISTANT: negative
