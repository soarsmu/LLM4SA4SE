A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Here too, you can access maBaseCell.mfValue directly, since we know ahead of time that both cells are of value type.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I'd expect that to autounbox.  Autounboxing *might* be less efficient, but it's more readable and won't matter much for a test.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: FIXME! As mentioned elsewhere, the polling wait is likely unnecessary in the  OpenCL implementation.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Warned about same in doc string. It'd be more safe to remove this method altogether.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: It's still an executable file. As opposed to, say, a Linux application that you build on Windows and which has a file with an extension .msi - that would most likely not be an executable.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Well - these files are still generated by autogen.sh, if no autogen.input is present. And when I asked on IRC, people told me they are still used.

Actually I was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input, instead of some more prominent header.

I actually don't see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments. For me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff.

ASSISTANT: neutral
