A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: For coreboot, maybe you could insert:

   assert(OpFlag == AccessWidth8);

before the "if" to ensure that coreboot users aren't tripped up.  I'm the first guy to discourage unnecessary changes to vendorcode, but this code is broken and we should somehow warn users about it.  It would be even better if we could make the code fail by static analysis instead of a runtime assert.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Make sure the smbus code is compiled and linked in.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: all 3 log methods now do make use of the instance variables: accountCache, groupCache, groupBackend
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Again, no new abstract functions in the API classes, please.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I am sorry. I just missed it before. errno should already be set to ENOENT if resolve/lookup fails. We shouldn't map any other genuine errors to ENOENT.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: These nOpCode have of course to be eFacOpCode then.
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
