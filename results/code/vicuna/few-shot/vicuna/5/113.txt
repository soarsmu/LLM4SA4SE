A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: This example contains both actual examples ("refs/*") and metalanguage ("permission"). Maybe pick one representation and stick to it?

 [access "<ref>"]
         <permission> = group Administrators

or

 [access "refs/*"]
         read = group Administrators

(Open re what formatting to apply to metalanguage.)

Example Sentence: I meant these, but we actually print the bypassLocal value with it so it doesn't matter much. Nevermind.
