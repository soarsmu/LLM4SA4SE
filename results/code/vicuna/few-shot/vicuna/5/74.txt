A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: call the function, pass the device also into the function
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Maybe pick a different name to avoid a collision with the field of the same name in Main?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: It is the same argument, that we want positive constants for time constants.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Please document these. is_precise is we know the exact type? Would 'exact' be clearer?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Don't encode the value right away.  Instead we should lazily encode the value only when the serialization stream needs it.  Thus the constructor is just:

  this.object = object;
  this.codec = codec;
  this.hash = object.hashCode();
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I don't think it needs to be set, which means it doesn't need to be in the input.
Label:
ASSISTANT: negative
