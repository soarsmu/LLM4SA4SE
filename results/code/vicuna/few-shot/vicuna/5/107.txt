A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: You can open as many issue tickets as you like. But we would still have to add all these tests in here, and find solution that fit them. Why delay?
Label: negative
Example Sentence: At least put // @todo something. Helps us keep track of what still needs to be looked at in the codebase.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I agree with the above comment ... the above logic change  should be in a separate patch than the channel handling
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: What happens if this fails? How do we ensure ssh is killed? Maybe a trap would be more supportable?
Label: negative
Example Sentence: [suggestion] Please use the following codes to do the operations in parallel:

local list=$(comma_list $(osts_nodes))

do_nodes $list $LCTL set_param -n obdfilter.*.read_cache_enable=1

do_nodes $list $LCTL set_param -n obdfilter.*.writethrough_cache_enable=1
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Ah, ok. Let me explain a bit: The USBIP server/client is split into two parts. On the server side, there's an userspace daemon (usbipd) and a kernel module usbip-host.ko. The client has a userspace tool (usbip) and a virtual usb hcd vhci-hcd.ko. 

So, get_usbip_message_len is split in the same manner.

The Device List, Import, .... Request/Response stuff (which has a protocl version 0x111) is the user space portion. The usbip-host.ko and vhci-hcd.ko part (aka URBs handling, version = 0x0000) is part of the kernel. You are right, I'll add comment which explains why the function got so convoluted.

ASSISTANT: neutral
