USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: What happens if the specified branch doesn't exist?  Will that be caught by the check at line 154?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: string.join() is deprecated. Please use ','.join(vmList).
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I think, we should replace this by getBySeverity() to avoid juggling with message types in userland
Label: non-negative

Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf.

I agree the name is not great - we can change it if you like. But the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use, so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Should this be all of the groups and not just controllers?
Label:
ASSISTANT: negative
