A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: It is a core class, why should it be independent from core usage?

"If you just assign an end date you have to jump in the source code to become an idea how the start date is resolved."

This can be written into the function comment, so if we may change $GLOBALS['EXEC_TIME'] we do not need to change so much calls.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: It isn't :(
https://android-review.googlesource.com/#/c/119847/
Label: negative
Example Sentence: shouldn't this function be called:  rewrite_blockinstance_config

note the 'c' in blockinstance

so this would need the misisng 'c' and the calls to it
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I feel like these explanatory comments belong in the code, not just the code review.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Should this just be
func Run() { etc }
and have callers explicitly call Register beforehand?
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: divider/spacer not needed any more - spaces should be created by t3skin itself
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
