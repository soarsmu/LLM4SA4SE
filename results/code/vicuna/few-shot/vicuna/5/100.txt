A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.

Example Sentence: It works pretty well and provides status information for impatient users. Note that nrms is a shared variable among the threads and that the line is overprint with the carriage return character in a fifo manner.

Example Sentence: Good point. I think it is related to the change as the new message is introduced here.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: All the names we've thought of for this suck, unfortunately. :(
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this
