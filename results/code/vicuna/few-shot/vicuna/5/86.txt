A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: No globals please if at all possible.

But more generally, this is a base class - please stick specific functionality into derived classes. You already did that in SlideFragmentHandler for parts of it - for PPT_TOKEN( text ), when it comes in the SlideFragmentHandler context, just generate a new child context - e.g. like new SlideTimingContext( *this, mpSlidePersistPtr->getTimeNodeList() ) in that file.

With that, you will get rid of that global state anyway.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Make these transient and lets just handle the serialization entirely ourselves.  That way we don't have to actually hold onto buf when we have the object form already on hand.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: May be you could add a comment where these constants are coming from?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I see, so I'll leave it to go to /dev/null. But is it enough if our websocket proxy writes to syslog?

About ">= 0.6": I monkeypatched the methods that are used by old websockify to use logger.

(What I'm worried about is the fact I see duplicate lines in syslog - one line comes from "journal", the other one from "ovirt-websocket-proxy" and they are identical. I need to investigate this further.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Removed the !commentPopupDialog.getEditable() check
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I just noticed this: please change god_mode to override_state as in this change: https://review.openstack.org/#/c/156203/8/nailgun/nailgun/test/integration/test_capacity_handler.py

ASSISTANT: non-negative
