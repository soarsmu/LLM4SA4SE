A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: renamed to __initPropertyProviders in this scope to indicate that we consider it private in this scope otherwise initPropertyProviders
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Can't we club these two cases something like :

case GF_SNAP_OPTION_TYPE_ACTIVATE:
        GF_SNAP_OPTION_TYPE_DEACTIVATE:
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: unused parameter 'pinfo' [-Werror=unused-parameter]
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: This should be safe because this string isn't really used in the GUI - it's used as one of the arguments in a later format string, so it's copied. In fact I could (and probably should) just use NULL instead of packet_scope().
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: unused parameter 'p_info' [-Werror=unused-parameter]


(p_info ? -> pinfo ?)
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing.

Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
