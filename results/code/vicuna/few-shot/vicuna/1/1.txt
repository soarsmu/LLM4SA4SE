A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: A better way to do this is
| awk '$2=="id" {print $4}'

it suffers from less false positives on the 'id' string, and it's more efficient.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: (improvement) It should be possible to test this with only 2 OSTs.  With a two-stripe file it would be missing stripe index 0.
