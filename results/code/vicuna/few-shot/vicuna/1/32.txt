A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Actually, I realized late last night that it probably didn't make sense to specify the damage using frects, since the damage is defined on pixel boundaries (I was originally thinking frect because sourceCrop is a frect, but that's not exactly analagous).

I think this should be hwc_rect_t. That probably implies that we should use hwc_region_t, except that size_t is way overkill and will eat another 8 bytes in 64-bit relative to this (since we're currently getting the uint32_t for free because of padding).
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Please don't hijack other chipsets. i82801gx is ICH7, not NM10
Label:
ASSISTANT: negative
