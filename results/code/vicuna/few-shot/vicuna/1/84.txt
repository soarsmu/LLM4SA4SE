A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: why do we json_encode() $scopeData here? We do not do this in the base class. Furthermore it is already serialized.

The only difference in this method compared to the one in the base class is now the Tree.thisScript stuff. The question therefore is: Is this a bug in the baseclass that Tree.thisScript is not set, or is it superfluous here?
If neither applies, then still the question remains, if there's a nicer way of adding this code snippet without overriding (and copyiing) the complete method from the base class?
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Shift + left click or drag to extend T1 of a current range always changes T1 to T2 (and T2 to T1)
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
