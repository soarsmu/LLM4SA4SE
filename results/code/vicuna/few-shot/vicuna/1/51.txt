A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Hi Nigel,

Is it better to use "nbsp;" instead of "."?

In case other screens want to use this in the future - it's more generic.

But, it's up to you.  

It actually works quite well the way it is.

Thanks,
Ghada
