A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: It probably is, but what happens when somebody upgrades the libvirt? Do we require vdsm restart as well? Or will it suddenly start working?
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: strdup_printf with just a %s can be replaced with just strdup :)

This copy is necessary though, since the string coming into the function might be packet-scope
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
