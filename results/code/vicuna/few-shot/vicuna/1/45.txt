A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I already have another use case. If an app needs per package log configuration (as in JDK), this is good way to support that. So I prefer to keep it as it doesn't complicate the code.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: never mind. found it in "notification_internal_activity" :) will see what I can do
Label:
ASSISTANT: Label: neutral
