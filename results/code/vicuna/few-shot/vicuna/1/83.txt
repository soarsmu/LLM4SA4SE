A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Don't use exceptions for control flow. Use Ints.tryParse instead.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I'll add a comment. 
I don't think #ifdef is a good idea. It makes bugs more likely because you have more code and that code is less tested (because only one version is only compiled and run on any one system).  But I will include the non-workaround version in the comment.
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
