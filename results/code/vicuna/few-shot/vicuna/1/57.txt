A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: No it doesn't "explode", I am not changing a sebool, I am changing the file context. Yes a restorecon would un-do the change. We'll need to file a request for that but for now this is good enough.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Sorry but I didn't get why we need 199 here - to trigger some update to 200 afterwards? What if we just fix the update for afterwards then?!?
Label:
ASSISTANT: negative
