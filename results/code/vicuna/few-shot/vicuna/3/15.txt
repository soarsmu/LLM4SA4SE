A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I did not get your point, please fix it as you think appropriate.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: As every callback is only interested at the part starting at the token, what about using frame + offset here and dropping the p - frame in the callbacks?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: m->total_size is untrusted input, whereas c and microcode end are trusted. There's no risk of overflow.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: No need for Provider here, inject FlushCashe directly. Both PostCaches & FlushCache are singletons. So the Provider hurts more than it helps here. E. g. on line 105 it get called in a loop and returns allways the same singleton instance.

ASSISTANT: positive
