A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: There is no putComment method. Shorten this and just put it on one line:

  checkState(psId != null, "setPatchSetId must be called first");

Developers debugging a failure can look at the Java stack trace to see how they got into this situation. What matters to them more is the call site where the object was misused, not which entry point into the object the error was discovered by.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Hmm I see what you mean. Yeah it might be possible to do what you describe.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Because it's racy. It should be guarded optimally with a lock that is not so global, but then you're talking about improvements that are in the nanosec granularity.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: These are wrapper functions, and will use in test cases directly.
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
