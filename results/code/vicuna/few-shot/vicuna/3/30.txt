A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Isn't the Config callback sufficient? It sounds tricky that a returned Config is valid only until the Config callback is called. If possible I prefer limiting the Config's life inside the Config callback and letting users maintain a copy of some info based on need.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: IMHO the probe*XML functions should simply take xmlTextReaderPtr. shared_ptr is only used to manage the lifetime of the reader, so it is impl. detail. I would even remove the typedef.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Please don't. See my comment in utils.py. Configure the logger with proper formatter instead.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Sure, I can switch over to a white-list. I just killed the ones I really didn't like (e.g. MD5 :).
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
