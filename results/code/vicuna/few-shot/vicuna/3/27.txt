A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: (style) convert in-between line to tabs.  Maybe consider converting the whole function to tabs?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: This example contains both actual examples ("refs/*") and metalanguage ("permission"). Maybe pick one representation and stick to it?

 [access "<ref>"]
         <permission> = group Administrators

or

 [access "refs/*"]
         read = group Administrators

(Open re what formatting to apply to metalanguage.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I don't understand the problem. Without the explicit assign, and copy operator, and without the AnalysisNeighborhoodSearch(const ImplPointer &) (not needed if the setMode is done easier), I don't see why it wouldn't just work by itself correctly with gmx_unique_ptr. Sorry if I'm miss something obvious.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: should probably also mention the the optimizer scale estmation was pushed into the parent class
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
