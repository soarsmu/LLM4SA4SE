A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Suppose I am an administrator,  I will look into the log file to find what is happening in VDSM.  You can not suppose administrator to check the console or the code to know this.  IMO, every faulty path should have a log in the log file.  You can argue that many places in VDSM are not doing these,  but it is a good practice for system service program.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: here as well: if ($value === NULL || strpos()...) { continue; }
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: How is 'bbox' supposed to be encoded for transmission over http?  Currently its encoded as a Javascript array, which is probably why its not behaving as expected.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: not worth including the regular version number too?

ASSISTANT: neutral
