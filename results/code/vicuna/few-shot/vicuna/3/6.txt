A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Don't think this is really needed. See comments in PartialStateSystem.

Also, protected fields, no no!
Label: negative
Example Sentence: This is device init path, is not it?
So changing the od_track_declares after the fact would not retroactively enable this feature?

We might as well change it to a module parameter then if this is the way we want to go?
Label: negative
Example Sentence: The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf.

I agree the name is not great - we can change it if you like. But the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use, so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: divider/spacer not needed any more - spaces should be created by t3skin itself
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
