A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Can you wrap arguments like this (containing search pattern) in double quotes please? Fish shell (and probably zsh and alike) fails to execute it without it.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Patch Set 1:

Sorry, the news be module is completely broken for me ... sql error, then namespace errors ...

but the news be module with 4-7 suffers from the exact error my patch has fixed which would be reintroduced with this "fix".

On top of that, there is no point to check for the object we just created, thus we either remove the check, then we are back to the state before my patch which creates a warning.

Please tell me the exact error that happens, otherwise I can not reproduce the regression.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: May be you could add a comment where these constants are coming from?
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Removed 'to' as the assertion is there for mostly documentation purposes.
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
