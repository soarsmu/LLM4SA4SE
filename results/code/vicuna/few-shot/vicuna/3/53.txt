A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Comment is inaccurate (the code assumes stripe offset is set).

 /* Make sure stripe offset is in OST list. */
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Enable the deprecation log here is not finally discussed. I'm 60/40 for not logging, because the deprecation log will get extremely flooded. When enabling, only the first setting (and not all three) should be logged to minimize the flood. The logging could be enabled in the next version, and till then it should be documented very well.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Agreed. We will need to get this repo setup and populated before these changes are approved and applied on any hosts.

Can anyone confirm if I have guessed an appropriate name for the repository?
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing.

Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
