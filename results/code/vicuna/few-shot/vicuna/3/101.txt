A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: That will unfortunately only work if there are no 4-core Intel Xeons that work in dual-socket configuration because we could confuse a workstation that has two such processors with an 8-core Xeon E5 in single-socket configuration.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: (I think you could indent this line another four spaces if you want.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: TableID is specified to be 8 characters. While the original version broke that by adding a space, I guess it's simply ignored. With this change, the final "M" would be dropped, too.

(When you fix that, also cut OEMID to 4 characters, it's 32bit. ACPI5.0 19.5.28)
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Ok, I've changed the method name to 'validate'. Not sure though if it's worth the effort to change the already existing listeners.
Label:
ASSISTANT: neutral
