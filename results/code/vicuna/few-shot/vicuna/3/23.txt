A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Comment should have a space and uppercase the first letter like in the other comments.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Should this just be
func Run() { etc }
and have callers explicitly call Register beforehand?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Make sure the smbus code is compiled and linked in.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Since BE was IE10 (as of the member var above) I think changing the member to edge is not a problem, but I would keep the IE8 default here, which does not hurt us, and will also not hurt third party stuff then.
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
