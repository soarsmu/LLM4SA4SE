Example Sentence: Hrm, I'm not sure how best to handle this.  StackOverflow has a 'Display Name' attribute, does anything similar exist for LDAP & OpenID?

I'd prefer to just show the firstname to save on space.  If we end up showing the full name, I wonder if we could put the name to the left of the search bar and have the search bar expand over it when active, to save on horizontal space.
