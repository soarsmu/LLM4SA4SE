A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Note that this means envp is empty, while you fill in LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, and TMPDIR in the gomobile code.  I'm not sure how to get the environment or if it's even necessary. (All the Go environment functions in runtime assume that Go has already been somewhat initialized.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: This is unnecessary, only MWExtensionInspector uses nodeModel
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Intentionally made this INFO, as restore being a not so common operation this log wouldn't be quite frequent, and also it's good to know why and who stopped bricks in these cases for debugging later, coz most customer setups don't run in debug mode
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: This TODO will have to wait for a later bug fix, because it's used when users belong to multiple institutions (the progress bar gives them a menu to determine which institution to show, and that relies on the param).

It's not a *huge* security issue having this. It just allows users to see what the completion goals are for other institutions they're not members of.

ASSISTANT: neutral
