A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: 1. This seems like a hack to work around a bug -- why are we reading from the pty after it is closed?
2. This hack also looks too broad -- if any error occurs we close the pipe and stop reading, while squelching the error. This seems bad.

Same comments below.
ASSISTANT: 1. Negative sentiment.
2. Negative sentiment.
