A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: This TODO will have to wait for a later bug fix, because it's used when users belong to multiple institutions (the progress bar gives them a menu to determine which institution to show, and that relies on the param).

It's not a *huge* security issue having this. It just allows users to see what the completion goals are for other institutions they're not members of.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral.
