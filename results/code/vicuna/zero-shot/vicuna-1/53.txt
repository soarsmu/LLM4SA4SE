A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing.

Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral.
