A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free.

Another concern is that when it is called by MethodInliner, actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by MethodInliner, not all the modified methods since last DeadCodeElimination. The result would be the same, but it may do unnecessary work in MethodInliner.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral.
