A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I think that's just a mistake in make.bash.  It's better to fail fast and minimize distractions to stderr when you know you've already lost.

I'd say add an exit failure here and then submit. If you feel strongly about keeping it as-is, you can submit this too and we can fix them both later if we decide to.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral.
