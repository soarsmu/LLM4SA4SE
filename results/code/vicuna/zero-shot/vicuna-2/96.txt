A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: But not how it's currently implemented. Instead the interwikimap should be consulted to see whether a interwiki link is local, and as soon as a non-local interwiki link is happening throwing this exception (but as InvalidTitle of course).

How is en:meatball:Foo an invalid link? I've added that to the link tests and it's fine. And en:meatball:en:Foo doesn't work as the meatball wiki appears to have no interwiki map.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in the sentence is negative.
