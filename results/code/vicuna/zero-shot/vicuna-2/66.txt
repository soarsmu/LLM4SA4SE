A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: If it's not set, there's no way to get FSP failure data out.  I agree that it's not an absolute requirement, but without it, if there's a failure, you're going to be pretty lost.

We could move it from here and put this below, surrounding the #if statements and not actually fail, but my opinion was this was the best option...
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is (2) neutral. The writer is stating a fact about the importance of a certain piece of data, but is not expressing a strong positive or negative emotion about it.
