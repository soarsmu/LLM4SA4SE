A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: In the follow-up change [1] this method is renamed to 'canEditChangeLabels' [2]. I would propose to name it already here 'canEditChangeLabels' so that it doesn't need to be renamed in the next change.
