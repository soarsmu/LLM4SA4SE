A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Since BE was IE10 (as of the member var above) I think changing the member to edge is not a problem, but I would keep the IE8 default here, which does not hurt us, and will also not hurt third party stuff then.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral.
