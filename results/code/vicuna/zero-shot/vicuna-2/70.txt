A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Is there a function for this query already? or should we make one for future?

It is just that this is quite a big block of code, and would be more readable factored out
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral. The reviewer is suggesting that it would be helpful to know if there is already a function for the query, or if a new function needs to be created for future use. They also mention that the current block of code is quite large and would be more readable if it were factored out.
