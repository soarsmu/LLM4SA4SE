A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: This is the same as in the underlying OS calls, and this same construct is also used in the nbsearch pair loop, as it minimizes the amount of code the caller needs to write for correct looping (and is quite easy to implement, as there's only one function that returns something).
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is (2) neutral.
