A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Ahh, I see.  :)

I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class.  Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead?

Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader?  Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in the sentence is neutral.
