A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: strdup_printf with just a %s can be replaced with just strdup :)

This copy is necessary though, since the string coming into the function might be packet-scope
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence is neutral.
