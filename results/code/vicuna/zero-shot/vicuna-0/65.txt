A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Patch Set 4: Code-Review+2

Now it looks good, yeah it worked in the first patch set but the rebase missed the comma
ASSISTANT: The sentiment label for this sentence is "positive".
