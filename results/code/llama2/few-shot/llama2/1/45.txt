Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I already have another use case. If an app needs per package log configuration (as in JDK), this is good way to support that. So I prefer to keep it as it doesn't complicate the code.
Label: non-negative
