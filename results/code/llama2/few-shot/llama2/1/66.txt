Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: what means "error_expected" = "create". It's means there are nor error? then it's better to use None by default for self.input.param("error-expected", None)

and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean. python allows it but it's not good to change the type of variable
Label: negative

Sentence: If it's not set, there's no way to get FSP failure data out.  I agree that it's not an absolute requirement, but without it, if there's a failure, you're going to be pretty lost.

We could move it from here and put this below, surrounding the #if statements and not actually fail, but my opinion was this was the best option...
Label:

Sentiment: Neutral
