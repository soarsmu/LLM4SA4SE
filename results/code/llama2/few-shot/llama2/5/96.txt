Sentence: But not how it's currently implemented. Instead the interwikimap should be consulted to see whether a interwiki link is local, and as soon as a non-local interwiki link is happening throwing this exception (but as InvalidTitle of course).

How is en:meatball:Foo an invalid link? I've added that to the link tests and it's fine. And en:meatball:en:Foo doesn't work as the meatball wiki appears to have no interwiki map.
