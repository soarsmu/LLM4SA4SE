Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: That's not what I was saying. Just like
public static float getMdpiScaleFactor(Density density) {
 if (density == Density.ANYDPI) {
   density = Density.XXHIGH.getDpiValue();
 }
 return density.getDpiValue() / (float) Density.MEDIUM.getDpiValue();
}

But whatever, it's not a big deal.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Please explain on why it is been taken out from the switch case below.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Looking at all *Listener.java files in our source tree I see the following two cases:

* a listener is just notified that an event happened but cannot do anything to prevent/block that event. In that case the listener doesn't throw any checked exception(s). Examples: GitReferenceUpdatedListener, HeadUpdatedListener, AuditListener, ...

* a listener can block the event. In this case the listener throws a checked exception which is on the same level of abstraction as the listener interface. Examples: CommitValidationListener throws CommitValidationException, MergeValidationListener throws MergeValidationException, ...

Since this listener is not intended to validate/block a group membership change(s) it belongs to the first category and shouldn't throw any exception.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I'd have to dig a bit deeper into the blame history of this file to find out. As we can see at line 154 it's being deliberately kept open, rather than as an oversight.

If it needs fixing it can be done in a follow-up change.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The type would be TestNamespace::PtrSecCertificateGetData vs PtrSecCertificateGetData though.

I suggest moving the typedefs below the QT_BEGIN_NAMESPACE at line 94. Feel free to ignore this suggestion though since it's valid C++ either way.
Label: non-negative

Sure!

Sentence: If we agree to always treat a single number as JSON even if the client doesn't enable datatype support, then we can always set its datatype to JSON regardless of that.
