Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: If you dig into the code, at some point you will reach a very strange statement (a couple of calls from setCacheSize), qMax(qMin(.....), 25).
The size reported by that might differ from the size specified by the caller, in which case the caller should be informed of that. If you query cacheSize() you will get the value of the variable, not the value that was adjusted after the qMax(qMin...) calls.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: It's left intentionally like that, so that a patch that actually enables one LFP looks cleaner.
