Example Sentence: Yikes, we are starting an RPC for every row in the table?  My concern with this is the browser can only issue 4 requests at a time to the server.  If a user has 50 items in their dashboard, which many do, this will take quite a few round-trips (13!) to completely load the status codes.  Worse, if the user navigates away before they are completely done loading, they will continue to load, as there is no way to cancel the queued RPCs.

I would prefer having myApprovals and strongestApprovals take a Set<Change.Id> and return a Map<Change.Id, Whatever>, and make only one call to each method for the dashboard.

Sentence: Since BE was IE10 (as of the member var above) I think changing the member to edge is not a problem, but I would keep the IE8 default here, which does not hurt us, and will also not hurt third party stuff then.
