Example Sentence: Hi Nigel,

To expand on what Tobias said, when you change the content of a language string you also need to change its name. Otherwise the Launchpad translation site isn't smart enough to tell translators that they need to update it. See https://wiki.mahara.org/index.php/Developer_Area/Language_strings#Let_translators_know_when_lang_strings_change

So please change the string name to "editaccesspagedescription4". You'll also need to change the name of the string in the PHP files and templates where it is used.

Sorry about that!

Cheers,
Aaron

Sentence: Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

@Sebastian: Yeah we already discussed that, but since we don't have time to implement promises or similar for 1.0 it's still better than before. So for now we make sure to fetch the stuff early, but I agree we should add a TODO in there
