Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: The built search tree of mdds::flat_segment_tree is not preserved on copy/assignment. You have to call build_tree() here. Or do it just before use (and use is_tree_valid() to check if it is necessary, as every line is used more than once).
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: We certainly can use the errno here as we are invoking'fork'
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Please use one of the test helper methods which includes a timeout.

Combining the takeResults() into this method does not seem like enough of a reason to add a new wait method. We need to be able to adjust the timeouts in auto testing, so minimizing the number of helper methods is rather important.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: This is the line which triggers the crash.  createQmlObject() requires the calling context to be valid.  If this callback is invoked from C++ via the event loop, it has a chance to crash.

Note that using Damian's repro also uncovered a crash in QNetworkAccessFtpBackend::closeDownstreamChannel() which could hide the crash issue in QML, but that's a separate issue which needs to be tracked separately (the fix is trivial, just a null ptr check on the ftp ptr).
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I've shortened to isIPv4, but I don't think preferIPv4 is correct.  first(preferIPv4) seems reasonable, but partition(preferIPv4) doesn't actually prefer IPv4.
Label: negative
