Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I disagree. I don't think that would shorten the code by much.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Why not to include topic when this really implemented?
Label: negative
Example Sentence: you have create_port function with build in cleanup, it's better to use it

Example Sentence: Element. This one stuck out. I think the only ones to try to capitalize are "Allocation, Type, Element", since that trio is the dominant set of APIs for interacting with any sort of data from Java.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: My change provides two options for clobber. So, the client can pass its own new rev id to couchdb or ask couchdb to generate a new rev id. This code path corresponds to the second case. So, the flag and expiration values here will be overwritten by couchdb, and you won't get them through your changes in mc_tap.
Label: non-negative
