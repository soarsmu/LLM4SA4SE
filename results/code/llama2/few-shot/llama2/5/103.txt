Example Sentence: I would love to do this. The problem is that all SSH information is only available inside of the SSH project and the server project which implements the REST endpoints doesn't have a dependency on it. Since we don't want this dependency I don't know how to implement it.

On the other hand, if you have SSH enabled and you are interested in the SSH summary and connections you can retrieve this information via SSH. The REST endpoints are mainly important for installations where SSH is not available, but in this case there is also no SSH summary and no SSH connections. This is why I'm okay with the current solution of ignoring the SSH stuff in the REST endpoint.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Is this necessary though?  Would anything bad happen if we encode to utf-8?  Also, it looks like this exists to make sure that we aren't using utf-16 or something else, in which case we would definitely want to keep this even in python3.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: You're preforming this check multiple times.
it's better to create a separate function, in case we will need to add a new "localhost" name/ip

Sentence: We only move bonds to the same place or back. So bond j is always tested. In the extreme case there are no H-bonds and the loop is simply a copy from i to j=i. Also note that this code has been tested in the nbnxn_hybrid_acc branch.
