Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Maybe some info about the purpose (selecting node position?)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

I concur with jrbarnette@.  It sounds like we can do a separate issue/CL for removing the pragma.  To that end, I think a TODO() referring to that issue could be useful if added to this CL.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I see, so I'll leave it to go to /dev/null. But is it enough if our websocket proxy writes to syslog?

About ">= 0.6": I monkeypatched the methods that are used by old websockify to use logger.

(What I'm worried about is the fact I see duplicate lines in syslog - one line comes from "journal", the other one from "ovirt-websocket-proxy" and they are identical. I need to investigate this further.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I like this test case because it is more realistic than the expression above. But then, I'd prefer that we remove the other one.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: but only replacing them in the copy of the string that gets written to fo? we're returning the original string?

(i guess 'parse' is just misleading. we're copying to the 'tmp' file and rewriting one particular entry but returning the original of what we just overwrote.)
Label: negative

Sure!

Sentence: This just feels wrong. The test setup code should not be writing to the notedb separately; there should be a method in PatchLineCommentsUtil that writes to the appropriate storage(s) based on the config.
