LGTM with a couple of small optional suggestions.  I agree that using more realistic sites to consume memory would be nice, but I think getting something up and running soon would be valuable as well.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I checked, and git does not clear the environment to run hooks. I also can't find subversion's reasoning around clearing it, so barring finding out that there's a good reason to, I think I'll just remove this line.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: rename to: initPropertyProviders? (and also in recompile_lib.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Here too, you can access maBaseCell.mfValue directly, since we know ahead of time that both cells are of value type.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: i think we're better off just taking the auto-generated stub like we did in the original patch. it doesn't hurt anyone that there's dead code at the end because the syscall never returns, and it's arguably more confusing to be insisting on supplying our own stub.
