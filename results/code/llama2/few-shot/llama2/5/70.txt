Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Should this just be
func Run() { etc }
and have callers explicitly call Register beforehand?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: That means we'll have to add an extra boolean field to every member. It'll make serialization size bigger as well as resident AST memory go up. 

I'm happy to change it, but it seems like it trades off memory for readability.

You'd still have to handle "", because that's the way Java annotations work, you cannot have a default value of 'null'
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: These variables are only used in the next call, I'd remove them
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The 'all' link is a link that is js controlled - is 'follow' the right word to use here?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Patch Set 2:

Liron, so lets think:
Reconstruct flow:
Go throught all vds refresh and on case of some exception connect.
Recovery flow:
Go through all vds connect and after that refresh, no need for exception handling on case of exception at refresh.
especially additional refresh.
No need for additional method that u introduced.
Where it is 99% percent common. You already introduced a method that at some flow should return only true and complicated a very simple code. "right now there is no need to copy the method in my opinion - 99%" - your change at connectAndRefreshAllUpHosts in order to solve bug at reconstruct flow caused to regression in recovery flow. I don't think that these means 99% common.
Label: negative

Sure!

Sentence: Is there a function for this query already? or should we make one for future?

It is just that this is quite a big block of code, and would be more readable factored out
Label:

Sentiment: neutral
