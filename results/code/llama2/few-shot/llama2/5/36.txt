Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: the previous event may not be traceEvGoCreate, like this scenario:
when trace start goroute is in syscall and then exitsyscall and finally goStart.
For this case, we can't access the stack information because the previous event is traceEvGoSysExit which doesn't contain the stack.
I just think out a solution:
when we receive a traceEvGoSysExit, we reserve the gocreate event by link it and access it here. But I don't know if there are any other cases or any side effect, any idea?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: New messages don't have description in MessagesQqq.php or maintenance/language/messages.inc
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: c.patchSetId isn't automatically populated.  You need to ensure its filled in yourself, unless you use the one that is already parsed and computed during validateChangeList() and stored inside of the commits map.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The language style needs to be instructive rather than conversational here.  This is primarily intended for the software guide.

Remove the "Therefore" and "For instance" and make the sentences more authoritative.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Along the same vein of getting the class's METADATA_TYPE when deserializing the response, since you are checking if the METADATA_TYPE is located in the json_dict, you could reference the class's METADATA_TYPE directly.

(I should have seen this in the last code review)

  if DriverInfo.METADATA_TYPE in json_dict:
      <body>

The same applies for the properties keyword check in line 67.
