Example Sentence: Since this script will go in ITK's tree and not the hooks, it should be licensed as the rest of ITK (which will soon be Apache but is not yet AFAIK).  Besides, the rest of the Apache license infrastructure (LICENSE and NOTICE) is not present yet.  Also, we should assign the copyright to the Insight Software Consortium for code going in ITK proper.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The include won't become redundant as the macros will still be needed. Instead the replicated Check{C,CXX}CompilerFlag.cmake will become redundant.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Might be better to move this test to right after the docio_read_doc_key_meta call, since it's doing the error handling for it. If there was an error, there's no point in populating 'doc' and '*doc_offset', right?
Label: non-negative
