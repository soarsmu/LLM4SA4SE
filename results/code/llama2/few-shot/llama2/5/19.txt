Example Sentence: As of now, some caller assumes that the returned ref is not nil when the returned err is nil. When this assumption is not valid, as the original code shows, subsequent actions on the returned ref would cause NPE and lead to GOXDCR crashes, which caused the issue in MB-18266. 

Returning a metadataNotFound err here is more correct conceptually, since this code is called from query APIs for remote cluster refs, and not being able to find the ref is an error condition. It will result in more consistent and predictable behavior -- the aforementioned issue will no longer occur.
