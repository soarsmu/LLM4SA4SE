Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.

Also typically in Python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Should we set "io->ci_ignore_layout = 1" under such case? then subsequent layout processing can be ignored.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: but only replacing them in the copy of the string that gets written to fo? we're returning the original string?

Label: negative
Example Sentence: Will the servicename have other characters at this point?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Since this script will go in ITK's tree and not the hooks, it should be licensed as the rest of ITK (which will soon be Apache but is not yet AFAIK).  Besides, the rest of the Apache license infrastructure (LICENSE and NOTICE) is not present yet.  Also, we should assign the copyright to the Insight Software Consortium for code going in ITK proper.
Label: non-negative
