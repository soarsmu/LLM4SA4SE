Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: This should also be converted GF_VALIDATE_OR_GOTO, take this as global comment
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Put a comment, and explain two different use cases:

* 1. Existing edit is deleted:

  DELETE /changes/<id>/edit

* 2. Path in non existing edit is deleted, IOW new edit is created by deleting a path in current patch set for a change:

  DELETE /changes/<id>/edit/path%2fto%2ffile
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: It's left intentionally like that, so that a patch that actually enables one LFP looks cleaner.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: There are two cases to be covered: 1) When the tokens are empty (this is the one you did); 2) Also, when you do have 1 comment token but the offset is *before* its begin.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: This should probably be dlfcn, but I'm not sure.

It might be better to split this into another file, and call it something like pthread_dlfcn_test.cpp to indicate this is really a test that is also testing dl related functionality.
Label: negative

Sure!

Sentence: I will remove all of the debug and most of the other messages after the VectorImage is working.  Main reason to use the Logger is to print interleaved messages from multiple threads legibly.  Other reason I'm avoiding debugMacro until VectorImage is working is so that I can continue to see debug messages even when compiled in Release mode for speed.
