Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: What about abstracting this even further: instead of requiring a region_device to describe the location, we could just accept the name of an FMAP region and look up its offset and size.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The user might still want to disable it...

Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Why not just adjust the check upstairs to 
(m->total_size?:2048) > (microcode_end - (u32)c)
then you won't need this check if you assume that cbfs is correct and if you don't cbfs check belongs to cbfs functions, not here.
Label: negative
