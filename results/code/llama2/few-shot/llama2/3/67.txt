Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: This and the preferences load below have a race condition. If the plugin load finishes first the user might see the existing account dashboard screen instead of their first My link if token = MINE.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: (style) I don't understand why this is in its own scope?  It just causes all of the code to be indented further for no particular benefit.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Should have caught this earlier, ret would be reset to 0 here on succesful cleanup of source, but actual migration may want to signal a failure with ret as -1, so we would need to use a different variable or reset ret to its original.
Label: non-negative
