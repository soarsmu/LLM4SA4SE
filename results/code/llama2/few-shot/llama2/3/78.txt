Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: They're not, and can't be. Same as with proto fields that this code is a copy of... and quite a few other pre-existing Lua code spots too for that matter.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: sizeof("") includes the trailing '\0'. Couple more of this
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: OK, will change it - there was a debate about whether we should also check for 'false', 'False' etc., which is why it was a list.  I left it like that in case we changed our minds!  Provided we don't, I'll just make it a simple equality check!
Label: non-negative
