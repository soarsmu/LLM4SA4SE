Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: This seems confusing to me. It reads like "If -ENOSYS is returned on the 1st iteration, then FMR is not supported", which gave me the impression that "-ENOSYS can be returned in later iterations too, in which case it does not indicate FMR is not supported".

Rather, please consider:
if (rc == -ENOSYS) { /* device does not support FMR */
      LASSERT(i == 0);
      break;
}
Label: negative
Example Sentence: OUString::replaceAll does not modify the OUString but returns a new OUString instead.
this means that when converting an existing String *Replace* call you need to assign the returned value to the original string.

you should get a warning about an "unused result" here but strangely
i'm not seeing a warning with gcc 4.7, no idea why...
at least the Clang tinderbox caught the problem.

fixed in commit 03a381eaa58d77cf26dfa8d916d1ecda865c1937
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Why not use:

if ($limit > 0) {

} elseif ($limit < 0) {

}
Label: negative

Sentence: But not how it's currently implemented. Instead the interwikimap should be consulted to see whether a interwiki link is local, and as soon as a non-local interwiki link is happening throwing this exception (but as InvalidTitle of course).

How is en:meatball:Foo an invalid link? I've added that to the link tests and it's fine. And en:meatball:en:Foo doesn't work as the meatball wiki appears to have no interwiki map.
