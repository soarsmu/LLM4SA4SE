Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Not sure why all these if statements are necessary... see the definition for optional_str() on line 579
Label: negative
Example Sentence: My point is that div_fsys1 is probably a fixed size as defined by the data sheet, and an unsigned int is not. So if it's a 32 bit value, as suggested by the fact that you're reading it with readl below, you should use uint32_t to ensure it's the right size. That struct might need to be fixed up too.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Change looks fine, but please fix up this bad rebase.
Label: negative
