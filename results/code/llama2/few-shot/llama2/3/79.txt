Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I guess it's because hasRole only returns boolean, and the array key is needed as well..
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I thought the point of the platform file is to make it easier by requiring only one option. Of course the user can also simply use "CC=icc CXX=icpc CFLAGS=-mmic CXXFLAGS=-mmic". If I don't specify the compiler then what's the point of having a platform file at all? 

I'm pretty sure gcc will never support the MIC vector instructions (compiling with gcc works but is of course useless without the vector instructions). And it seems also very unlikely that clang will ever support it.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I generally prefer not to be credited in source files.
Label: non-negative
