Hi ananth,
I agree with Markus that I'm in favor of not merging this.

What xml parser ate you using that is not capable of empty, closing tags? Esp. if you set the HTML tendering mode to XHTML, the output is a subset of XML.

If you need to have empty closing tags replaced by q dedicated closing tag for a special use case, you could ask on http://forum.typo3.org to figure out a solution for you. I'm confident that it's possible, however I would not change TYPO3's default behavior.
Thanks for your understanding.

Yours Steffen
