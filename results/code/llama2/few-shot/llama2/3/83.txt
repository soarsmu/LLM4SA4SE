Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I think, we should replace this by getBySeverity() to avoid juggling with message types in userland
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: This should be a programlisting with language 'ini'
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Agree displayable is not ideal. Looking for something that means "not internal". How about getNonInternalFieldModifiers()?

Given they're hidden APIs / internal comments I suggest not wasting any time on this: my point is the comment is not as clear to me as I think it could be.

Feel free to act on the suggestion or ignore. The later draft is clearer.
Label: non-negative

Sure!

Sentence: I'll add a comment. 
I don't think #ifdef is a good idea. It makes bugs more likely because you have more code and that code is less tested (because only one version is only compiled and run on any one system).  But I will include the non-workaround version in the comment.
