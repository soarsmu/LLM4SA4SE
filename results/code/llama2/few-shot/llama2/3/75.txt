Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: This line ought to use the variable to say:
'token' => "A token previously acquired with $action",
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Then maybe the loop can be inside this method, it would be more consistent with the fact that 'Starts' is plural...
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: s/importsSet/pkgSet/

should explain that this set is only needed so we can create an duplicate free pkgList
Label: non-negative

Sentence: Which comment? :)

Good idea. I'll update to explicitly call out CANARY_MASTER.

It doesn't work b/c Initialize is mocked out in the sync_stage unit test, so self.repo never gets initialized and is None in the conditional logic. Haven't looked too far into why it's not being triggered for 'master-release', but I suspect that config simply doesn't run this unit test.
