Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Alternative? The ret pointer will be free'd outside of this function, therefore I need to return a pointer here. and *ret is assigned NULL above (instead of the g_new as before).

If I'd return just NULL, it would add complexity to code outside.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Why can't this go int QTypeinfo?  (i would like to have it there to enable some feature of QWeakPointer only for QObject for example)
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Just wondering if _nl_addr_cache and _nl_link cache can be factored somehow with a common helper.
Label: non-negative
