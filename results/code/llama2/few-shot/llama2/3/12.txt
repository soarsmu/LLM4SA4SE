Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Why can't this go int QTypeinfo?  (i would like to have it there to enable some feature of QWeakPointer only for QObject for example)
Label: negative
Example Sentence: This should be just 'Authentication required' to make the message consistent with other REST endpoints.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Yes, it is a bug in adb, no ambiguity here, but it's really subtle, so it'd be nice to have a better description of the problem, it's not really Python specific as you mention, i.e. something like:

"""
Some programs want to launch an adb command and collect its output by calling CreateProcess with inheritable stdout/stderr handles, then using read() to get its output. When this happens, the stdout/stderr handles passed to the adb client process will also be inheritable.

When starting the adb server here, care must be taken to reset them to non-inheritable.

Otherwise, something bad happens: even if the adb command completes, the calling process is stuck while read()-ing from the stdout/stderr descriptors, because they're connected to corresponding handles in the adb server process (even if the latter never uses/writes to them).
"""

The PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST isn't directly related to the problem, and not needed in this specific case because I don't think there are multiple threads being used in the adb client process (at least when reaching this code). It's probably better to avoid mentioning it, or add a note like "ideally, use PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_HANDLE_LIST if running on Vista or higher"
