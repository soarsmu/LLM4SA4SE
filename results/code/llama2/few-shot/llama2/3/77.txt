Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: If I understand this right the buildr process is able to load Java classes dynamically and invoke them with reflection? That does it make it slightly easier to do some complex steps.
Label: non-negative

Sentence: Ahh, I see.  :)

I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class.  Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead?

Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader?  Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?

Sure! Here's the sentiment analysis:
