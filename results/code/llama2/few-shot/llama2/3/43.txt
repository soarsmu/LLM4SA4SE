Example Sentence: Add:

    When you copy a manifest object, the new object is a "normal" object -- not a copy of the
    manifest. Instead it is a concatenation of all the segment objects. This means that you cannot
    copy objects larger than 5GB in size.

    All metadata is preserved during the object copy. If you specify metadata on the request to copy
    the object (either the PUT or the COPY), the metadata overwrites any conflicting keys on the
    target (new) object.

Sentence: This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period.

Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here.

One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.
