Sentence: Well - these files are still generated by autogen.sh, if no autogen.input is present. And when I asked on IRC, people told me they are still used.

Actually I was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input, instead of some more prominent header.

I actually don't see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments. For me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff.
