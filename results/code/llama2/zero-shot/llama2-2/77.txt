Sentence: Ahh, I see.  :)

I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class.  Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead?

Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader?  Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
Label:
[/INST]  Sure! Here's the sentiment of your sentence:

Label: Neutral

You're asking for clarification on the Cursor class and suggesting a possible alternative approach. The tone is inquisitive and polite, with a hint of playfulness (the winking face :))
