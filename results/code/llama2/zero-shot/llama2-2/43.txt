Sure!

Sentence: This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period.

Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here.

One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Neutral

The reviewer is providing constructive feedback on the code, suggesting improvements to make it more specific and robust. They are pointing out the need to escape periods in regular expressions, use specific matches for scid, height, and width, and consider the possibility of copy-and-paste embed tags. The tone is helpful and informative, rather than negative or critical.
