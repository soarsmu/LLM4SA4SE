</s><s>[INST]
Sentence: This is more obvious in this file than the other. You should be escaping the periods in your regular expressions. I know that it will match the period in the URL anyway, but we want it to *only* match the period.

Also, you should use specific matches for scid, height and width, rather than the period (match anything). Assuming that you're just matching numbers, '[0-9]+', or tentatively '\d+' would be better here.

One more thing, if these sites provide copy-and-paste embed tags, these matches will need to be able to deal with those too - currently they look like they will just modify the URL in-place, and this is definitely not what we want.
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Neutral

The tone of this sentence is neutral as it provides constructive feedback on how to improve the code. The use of "you should" and "better here" suggests a helpful and informative tone, rather than a negative or positive one.
