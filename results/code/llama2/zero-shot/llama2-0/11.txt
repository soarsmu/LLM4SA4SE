Sentence: This TODO will have to wait for a later bug fix, because it's used when users belong to multiple institutions (the progress bar gives them a menu to determine which institution to show, and that relies on the param).

It's not a *huge* security issue having this. It just allows users to see what the completion goals are for other institutions they're not members of.
