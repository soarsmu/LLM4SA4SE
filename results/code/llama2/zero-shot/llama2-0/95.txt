Sentence: The word "Selected" should be capitalized. I'm unsure of the use of "Area" here, BTW. Maybe "Cut Selection"?
Label:
[/INST]  Sure, I can help you with that! Here's the sentiment analysis of the sentence you provided:

Label: Positive

Here's why:

* The word "Selected" is capitalized, which indicates that it is a proper noun or a specific term that has been chosen deliberately. This could be interpreted as a positive aspect of the code review.
* The use of "Cut Selection" instead of "Area" could be seen as a more precise and specific term, which could also be interpreted as a positive aspect of the code review.

Overall, the sentence you provided has a positive tone, as it suggests that the code review is focusing on specific and deliberate changes, rather than general or vague ones.
