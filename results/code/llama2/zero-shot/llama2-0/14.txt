Sentence: Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization).

Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).
