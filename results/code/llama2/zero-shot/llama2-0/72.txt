Sentence: I'm not sure we would ever remove this. When running the Super Dev Mode from a static html page instead of a server, people link directly to .nocache.js, so it should always exist.
Label:
[/INST]  Sure! Based on the sentence you provided, I would assign the label "neutral" because the speaker is expressing uncertainty about removing the file and highlighting a practical reason why it should continue to exist. The tone is informative and matter-of-fact, rather than expressing a strong positive or negative emotion.
