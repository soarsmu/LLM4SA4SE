Sentence: I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free.

Another concern is that when it is called by MethodInliner, actually we want to traverse the methods that modified by MethodInliner, not all the modified methods since last DeadCodeElimination. The result would be the same, but it may do unnecessary work in MethodInliner.

[/INST]  Sure! Here's the categorization of the sentiment in the code review:

Sentence: I think it should be optimizerCtx.getLastStepFor(NAME)+1, since the methods which are last modified by DeadCodeElimination are deadcode-free.

Label: Positive

Reason: The user is suggesting an improvement to the code by pointing out that the methods modified by DeadCodeElimination are already deadcode-free, and therefore it is not necessary to traverse all the modified methods when calling MethodInliner. This shows a positive and constructive approach to the code review.
