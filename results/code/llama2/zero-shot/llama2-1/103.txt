Sentence: We only move bonds to the same place or back. So bond j is always tested. In the extreme case there are no H-bonds and the loop is simply a copy from i to j=i. Also note that this code has been tested in the nbnxn_hybrid_acc branch.
Label:
[/INST]  Based on the sentence you provided, I would categorize the sentiment as (2) neutral. The sentence describes a limitation of the code, specifically that bonds are only moved to the same place or back, and that in extreme cases there may be no H-bonds and the loop is simply a copy from i to j=i. However, the sentence also mentions that the code has been tested in the nbnxn_hybrid_acc branch, which suggests that the limitation has been acknowledged and addressed to some extent. Overall, the tone of the sentence is matter-of-fact and informative, rather than positive or negative.
