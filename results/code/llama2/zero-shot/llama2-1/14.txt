Sentence: Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization).

Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).
Label:
[/INST]  Sure! Here's the categorization of the sentiment in the given sentence:

Label: Neutral

The sentence expresses a neutral tone, as it mentions both the advantages and disadvantages of using generic serialization. The author acknowledges that generic serialization is a significant amount of code and requires careful thinking, but also mentions that it can be useful if the state can be generated using code that is not part of the test. Overall, the tone is balanced and objective, without any strong positive or negative emotions.
