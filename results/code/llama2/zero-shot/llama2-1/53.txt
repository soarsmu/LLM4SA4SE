Sentence: How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing.

Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Neutral

The sentence expresses a factual observation about the current state of the codebase and the need for a specific implementation. There is no emotional tone or bias in the sentence, and it does not express a positive or negative opinion. Therefore, the sentiment is classified as neutral.
