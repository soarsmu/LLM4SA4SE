</s><s>[INST]
Sentence: No need for Provider here, inject FlushCashe directly. Both PostCaches & FlushCache are singletons. So the Provider hurts more than it helps here. E. g. on line 105 it get called in a loop and returns allways the same singleton instance.
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Negative

Reason: The sentence expresses a negative opinion about the use of a Provider in the code, suggesting that it is not needed and may even cause harm by creating unnecessary overhead. The use of singletons is also criticized.
