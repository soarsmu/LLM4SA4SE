Sentence: Ah, ok. Let me explain a bit: The USBIP server/client is split into two parts. On the server side, there's an userspace daemon (usbipd) and a kernel module usbip-host.ko. The client has a userspace tool (usbip) and a virtual usb hcd vhci-hcd.ko. 

So, get_usbip_message_len is split in the same manner.

The Device List, Import, .... Request/Response stuff (which has a protocl version 0x111) is the user space portion. The usbip-host.ko and vhci-hcd.ko part (aka URBs handling, version = 0x0000) is part of the kernel. You are right, I'll add comment which explains why the function got so convoluted.
