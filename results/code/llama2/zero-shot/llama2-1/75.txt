Sentence: Which comment? :)

Good idea. I'll update to explicitly call out CANARY_MASTER.

It doesn't work b/c Initialize is mocked out in the sync_stage unit test, so self.repo never gets initialized and is None in the conditional logic. Haven't looked too far into why it's not being triggered for 'master-release', but I suspect that config simply doesn't run this unit test.
