Sentence: planning to do that in a separate changelist for MB-14866:
1. merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure
2. maintain a vbMap instead of vbList in this service, so as to make vbno lookup/validation faster
3. do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service

you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map. Feel that it makes the code harder to read. we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway. Plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in MB-14866 re-cur.
