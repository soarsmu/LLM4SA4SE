Sentence: You are mixing two different use cases. Use case 1:

  beginTransaction()
  commit()

this works, because beginTransaction() set autoCommit=false and commit is successful even though nothing to commit.

Use case 2:

  open Connection with autoCommit=true
  commit()

Evidently, this doesn't work on all Jdbc dialects supported by Gerrit. E. g. this doesn't work on PostgreSQL for the same reason why rollback() doesn't work. To see the failure, remove this if-guard above and run PostgreSQL unit test:

  testRollbackNoTransaction()

it is failing with:

  Cannot commit when autoCommit is enabled.

or some such.
Label:
[/INST]  The sentiment in the sentence is neutral. The author is simply stating two different use cases and their expected behaviors, without expressing any emotion or opinion.
