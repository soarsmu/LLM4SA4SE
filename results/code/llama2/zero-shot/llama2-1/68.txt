</s><s>[INST]
Sentence: This isn't C. Stop comparing it with C. What you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing. Both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness, \DSPC.BRTU and \DSPC.BRTD, so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim.
Label:
[/INST]  Sentiment: Negative

The speaker is expressing frustration and disappointment with the current approach, suggesting that it is not productive to compare the current code with C and that the redefinition of brightness variables is not necessary. The tone is direct and critical, with a hint of sarcasm.
