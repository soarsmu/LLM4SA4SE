ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Ahh, I see.  :)

I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class.  Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead?

Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader?  Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: neutral
