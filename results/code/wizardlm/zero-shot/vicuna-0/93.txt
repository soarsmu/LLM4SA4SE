A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: This just feels wrong. The test setup code should not be writing to the notedb separately; there should be a method in PatchLineCommentsUtil that writes to the appropriate storage(s) based on the config.
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: negative
