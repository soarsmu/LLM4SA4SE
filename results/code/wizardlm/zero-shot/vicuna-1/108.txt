A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Well - these files are still generated by autogen.sh, if no autogen.input is present. And when I asked on IRC, people told me they are still used.

Actually I was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input, instead of some more prominent header.

I actually don't see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments. For me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in the given sentence is (2) neutral. The user is discussing the use of autogen.sh and autogen.input files in code reviews, providing some context and their own thoughts on the matter. They don't seem to have a strong positive or negative opinion about it, but rather present a balanced view of the situation.
