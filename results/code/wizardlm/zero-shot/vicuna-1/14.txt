A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Not currently. It's somewhat different from what the current reference data approach uses, as I guess that you would want to generate that state using some code that is not part of the test (since if you can generate the state with code that runs anywhere, you do not really benefit from serialization).

Generic serialization is also a significant amount of code, even if straightforward (and with C++, it requires some careful thinking on what kind of constraints it enforces on the serializable types, unless you make the object itself responsible for the serialization).
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in the given sentence is (2) neutral. The author is discussing the current approach and its differences from a proposed approach, providing a thoughtful analysis of the potential benefits and drawbacks of each approach. The author also mentions some considerations for implementing serialization in C++, but does not express a strong positive or negative opinion on the matter.
