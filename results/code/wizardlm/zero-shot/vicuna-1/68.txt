USER: Please categorize the sentiment expressed in the following sentence from code reviews as either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: This isn't C. Stop comparing it with C. What you are doing here with the brightness is just redefining the same thing. Both boards you touched have the same definitions for the brightness, \DSPC.BRTU and \DSPC.BRTD, so it makes limited sense to redefine them as something interim.
ASSISTANT: The sentiment expressed in this sentence from a code review is negative.
