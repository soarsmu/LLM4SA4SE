A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Sorry, this is still unacceptable. ImplEESdrWriter::ImplWriteShape() is used by both the binary export and the OOXML filter, you need to set the OOXML flag in the OOXML filter. Jut put a breakpoint on this line in the debugger, see its backtrace, and set the flag in the first method that is already OOXML-specific, and pass the bool around till this line.
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: (3) Negative
