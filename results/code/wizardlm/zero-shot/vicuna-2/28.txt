USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Patch Set 3: Code-Review-1

@Sebastian: Yeah we already discussed that, but since we don't have time to implement promises or similar for 1.0 it's still better than before. So for now we make sure to fetch the stuff early, but I agree we should add a TODO in there
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: (2) Neutral
