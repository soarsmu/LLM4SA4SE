A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Sorry but I didn't get why we need 199 here - to trigger some update to 200 afterwards? What if we just fix the update for afterwards then?!?
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: Negative
