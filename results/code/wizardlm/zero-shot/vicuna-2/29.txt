A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: :(  So we need to either port this file over to kernel style or not use goto's.  Since we started it before everyone decided kernel style was OK, we've been using a hacked-down google c++ style which forbids goto :/
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: (3) Negative
