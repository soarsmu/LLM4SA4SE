A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: This just feels wrong. The test setup code should not be writing to the notedb separately; there should be a method in PatchLineCommentsUtil that writes to the appropriate storage(s) based on the config.
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: (3) Negative
