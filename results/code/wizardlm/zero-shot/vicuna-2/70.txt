A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Is there a function for this query already? or should we make one for future?

It is just that this is quite a big block of code, and would be more readable factored out
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: (2) Neutral
