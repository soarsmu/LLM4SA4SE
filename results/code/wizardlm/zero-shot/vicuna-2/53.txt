A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: I will give you a sentence from code reviews. You need to reply with the sentiment expressed in the following sentence, either (1) positive, (2) neutral, or (3) negative.
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: How is determined which of the opcodes is actually taken during import of _xlfn.CEILING.MATH ? I think that's missing.

Note that now that we use RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler, the tables in sc/source/filter/oox/formulabase.cxx are only provided for API support (of which we actually don't know if anyone is using it at all). Our internal OOXML import/export doesn't use them anymore, so any "only for import / only for export" usage needs to be implemented differently.
ASSISTANT: Sentence 1:
The sentiment in this sentence is neutral. The speaker is asking for clarification on a specific process or decision-making method, without expressing any strong positive or negative feelings.

Sentence 2:
The sentiment in this sentence is negative. The speaker seems to be critical of the current situation, suggesting that the use of RID_STRLIST_FUNCTION_NAMES_ENGLISH_OOXML with the formula compiler may not be beneficial or effective. They also express uncertainty about whether anyone is using the provided tables for API support.
