A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Please use double quotes for EGL/egldefs.h and log/log.h. These headers are now local. Same comment for other files including them.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Well - these files are still generated by autogen.sh, if no autogen.input is present. And when I asked on IRC, people told me they are still used.

Actually I was told to keep the minimized info message to move config from autogen.lastrun.bak to autogen.input, instead of some more prominent header.

I actually don't see a reason to deprecate the configuration via autogen.sh commandline arguments. For me autogen.input is just an other way to configure stuff.

ASSISTANT: positive
