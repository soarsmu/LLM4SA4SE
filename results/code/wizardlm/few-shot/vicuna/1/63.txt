A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: What about abstracting this even further: instead of requiring a region_device to describe the location, we could just accept the name of an FMAP region and look up its offset and size.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: oh, good catch! funny this slipped in ... btw: ArrayUtility from extbase should be reviewed and at first glance it seems most of it could be merged to core ArrayUtility.
Label:
ASSISTANT: Sentiment: positive
