A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: huh? namedtuple() is a new-style class (otherwise __getattribute__ won't fly for it!).

Note that namedtuple(verbose=True) shows that it uses __slot__=() by default, so I'm all for the removal of this redundant line. However the commit message is confusing.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Can we write a test for this? It seems to be an important semantic aspect of the interface, worth recording.
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
