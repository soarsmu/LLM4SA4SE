A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I believe you can only have one appender configured. The file based one is more useful to me, but maybe not to others.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: How about:
while (next != null && next->asPhi()->GetRegNumber() == reg_number) {
  if (next->GetType() == GetType()) return next;
  next = next->GetNext();
}
return nullptr;
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: In my opinion this function is not required. ArrayIndexItems function can return one more array called counts (count for each entry).

NewSecondaryIndexEntry() method can be added with one more arg count.
During index inser,

you just need to iterate through itms, counts := ArrayIndexItems() and encode as NewSecondaryIndexEntry(itm,count)
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: This is the same as in the underlying OS calls, and this same construct is also used in the nbsearch pair loop, as it minimizes the amount of code the caller needs to write for correct looping (and is quite easy to implement, as there's only one function that returns something).
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
