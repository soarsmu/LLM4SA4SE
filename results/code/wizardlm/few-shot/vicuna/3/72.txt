A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Same caveat here about indexOf() and Search() results.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: This should be just 'Authentication required' to make the message consistent with other REST endpoints.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: So does this method import to both the in memory cache and the disk cache? If so, that would be the source of some performance hits. 

This method should:
1. Add the image to the in memory cache synchronously
2. Add the image to the disk cache asynchronously

If it doesn't do this currently, lets split the logic up now.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I'm not sure we would ever remove this. When running the Super Dev Mode from a static html page instead of a server, people link directly to .nocache.js, so it should always exist.
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
