Example Sentence: My change provides two options for clobber. So, the client can pass its own new rev id to couchdb or ask couchdb to generate a new rev id. This code path corresponds to the second case. So, the flag and expiration values here will be overwritten by couchdb, and you won't get them through your changes in mc_tap.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: As things like Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn are very popular right now I think we should have them in the list so that their proper icons are used.

Maybe we could have an Admin -> Extensions -> configuration form for this so an admin can add new options when needed that records the name that will appear in the dropdown and where to find it's related icon.

But maybe this will be a patch for a later time
