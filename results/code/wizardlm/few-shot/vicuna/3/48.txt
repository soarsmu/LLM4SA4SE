A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: with --xml, return code will be zero for both success and failures. This may fail for invalid Volume name.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: shouldn't it free the allocated memory here and return null if mkstemp() fails?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Also guessing, but if multiple loops act on the same vector and that vector exceeds a cache level, then you can do slightly better by alternating the order of loop traversal, so that you do re-use what you do have in cache.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Right, changing an SwField, which is part of the document model during export is bad. An export operation should just read the document model and serialize it in some format. Can't you set m_bCitation depending on what the field type is? Just put a breakpoint on the SwField constructor, get a backtrace and see where it's created -- hopefully the caller knows the field type.
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
