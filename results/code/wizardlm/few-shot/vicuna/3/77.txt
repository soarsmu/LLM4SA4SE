A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: "that all 4 projects are imported" or "that it imports all 4 projects"
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: What about abstracting this even further: instead of requiring a region_device to describe the location, we could just accept the name of an FMAP region and look up its offset and size.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: If I understand this right the buildr process is able to load Java classes dynamically and invoke them with reflection? That does it make it slightly easier to do some complex steps.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Ahh, I see.  :)

I'm not seeing an isEmpty() method for the Cursor class.  Should I check for moveToFirst == false instead?

Also, while I'm on this, is there a reason we call the CursorLoader parameter CursorLoaderLoader and the Cursor parameter cursorLoader?  Can I change them to just cursorLoader and cursor?

ASSISTANT: non-negative
