A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: i thinks that's the wrong one, the one that should be FROM is the "pl" library
Label: negative
Example Sentence: All the names we've thought of for this suck, unfortunately. :(
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Also guessing, but if multiple loops act on the same vector and that vector exceeds a cache level, then you can do slightly better by alternating the order of loop traversal, so that you do re-use what you do have in cache.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: never mind. found it in "notification_internal_activity" :) will see what I can do
