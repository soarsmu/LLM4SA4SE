A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Yeah, major documentation work in the next few weeks, so we can all use our time more efficiently when new or wasn't-paying-attention-then developers come on board. Today, only worried about completing the rc while not creating repeat work later! :-)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: this should be 0.

I believe the empty username is a valid name.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Consider merging these uncommon write barrier forms in to one function that takes flags.  I think there's a bug in the later atomic function fixes that this would help address.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: In the follow-up change [1] this method is renamed to 'canEditChangeLabels' [2]. I would propose to name it already here 'canEditChangeLabels' so that it doesn't need to be renamed in the next change.
