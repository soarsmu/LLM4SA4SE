A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: This causes a warning about missing UID in Eclipse.  Fixed with:

https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/#/c/59929/
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Sounds like it should be disabled. It is reasonable to run a whole multi-sim workflow (em, equil phases, simulate) in the same set of multi-dirs, so being able to use

 mdrun_mpi -multidir the-dirs* -deffnm equil-npt

would be a nice thing. I haven't tried -multidir with a non-default equil-npt that I remember though.

Should we be looking at doing the directory change for -multidir earlier than we do?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: We should not reset the current filter here, but still need to use it for incoming read operations, and then replace it with the new filter in an atomic way below.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: strdup_printf with just a %s can be replaced with just strdup :)

This copy is necessary though, since the string coming into the function might be packet-scope
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
