USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Where do we handle the COMPILER_RT_rmodules_$(4) ? Is that just included in the objs ?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: shouldn't this function be called:  rewrite_blockinstance_config

note the 'c' in blockinstance

so this would need the misisng 'c' and the calls to it
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: You're preforming this check multiple times.
it's better to create a separate function, in case we will need to add a new "localhost" name/ip
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Is this marked 'latest' in the other place it's defined?
