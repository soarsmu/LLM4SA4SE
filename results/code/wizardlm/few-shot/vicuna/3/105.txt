A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: how are we guaranteeing that when we invoke this clean up there are no threads consuming these RPCs?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: ctr is not something that we would want to call out in UI as users may not understand what it is about. Please use the expanded form in all cases.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I don't get it - you do not have the same keys here and in the rpm-based part. We'd like this to be a portability layer, so that Engine should not care if it's RPM or DEB.

Maybe the mapping is impossible - but it does not seem that there's an attempt here.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I'd probably make this _parseMemInfo. If we see that we need it outside this module we can always drop the leading underscore.
Label:
ASSISTANT: positive
