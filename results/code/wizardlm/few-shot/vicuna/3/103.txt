A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: there's no point shuffling the deckchairs though. assume that anything that's not C++ yet is a bug and should just be moved straight to C++.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Thanks for fixing it.

> What if the author disagrees with your negative vote and writes a reply to your comment explaining why he disagrees? If this change is filtered out there is a high chance to you miss this reply. 

But with this argumentation it is even more dangerous for me how it was originally:

  -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self

Why? I am maintainer and have power of -2. I review a change and decide to put my veto on it. But we all do mistakes, we all have feelings? In the end we are all people. What is if it was a wrong veto? The contributor try to explain me, in additional comments why he thinks the veto was wrong and that the impact of the change is *very* minimal and that thousands of people from hundreds of companies can't upgrade to the new version of the product and all that because of his veto. Nothing helps. Why?

Because I used your dashboard template, put this line and this change was filtered out:

   -label:Code-Review=-2,user=self
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I've uploaded an alternative in patch set 5, which you might dislike less :-)
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: We only move bonds to the same place or back. So bond j is always tested. In the extreme case there are no H-bonds and the loop is simply a copy from i to j=i. Also note that this code has been tested in the nbnxn_hybrid_acc branch.

ASSISTANT: neutral
