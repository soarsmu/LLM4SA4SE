A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Don't encode the value right away.  Instead we should lazily encode the value only when the serialization stream needs it.  Thus the constructor is just:

  this.object = object;
  this.codec = codec;
  this.hash = object.hashCode();
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Sounds good to me. I shall handle these changes in the separate patch. Thanks!
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: In my opinion a distinction needs to be drawn between IPv6 header bogus length and extension header bogus length. Whether all the different extension header should use the same expert_field or not for length is another issue, it's debatable but my current opinion is that they should be separate, i.e, ei_ipv6_routing_invalid_length, ei_ipv6_dstopts_invalid_length, etc. but if someone thinks differently please share.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Change to:

$string['pendingsince'] = 'pending since %s';
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
