A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: whoops, this is not new code, but docs are always good!
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Looks like the null should be dropped. Previously it was null for the attributes, then Evonne added {'class': 'title'}
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: That's not what I was saying. Just like
public static float getMdpiScaleFactor(Density density) {
 if (density == Density.ANYDPI) {
   density = Density.XXHIGH.getDpiValue();
 }
 return density.getDpiValue() / (float) Density.MEDIUM.getDpiValue();
}

But whatever, it's not a big deal.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: No need to check for NULL because g_strdup will do this.
And if value == NULL then tv->value will be uninitialised.
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
