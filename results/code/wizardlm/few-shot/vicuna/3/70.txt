A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: We do realize that the given glfd pointer, could now have been reallocated and hence pass all these checks still and crash, right? just checking :)

Ideally if we want to validate that this is a good pointer, which we sort of cannot unless we have  a table of valid pointers and check against that etc. or hand out numbers and map that into a table.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Sorry. I did not closely looked into log date part. Thanks for this patch
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Nope, forgot to cherry-pick that one. Thanks for noticing, fixed.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Is there a function for this query already? or should we make one for future?

It is just that this is quite a big block of code, and would be more readable factored out
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
