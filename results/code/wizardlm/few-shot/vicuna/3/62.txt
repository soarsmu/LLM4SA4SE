A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Couldn't this be simplified inline to rebalance_completed () ?
Please note rebalance_completed has a bug, you should only check for 'completed' status instead of inversing for 'in progress'.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: here the indentation is wrong ;-)

However, the main question is if the assignments should be aligned in a line or if a single space would be enough indentation...
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Patch Set 1: I would prefer that you didn't submit this

Hi ananth,
I agree with Markus that I'm in favor of not merging this.

What xml parser ate you using that is not capable of empty, closing tags? Esp. if you set the HTML tendering mode to XHTML, the output is a subset of XML.

If you need to have empty closing tags replaced by q dedicated closing tag for a special use case, you could ask on http://forum.typo3.org to figure out a solution for you. I'm confident that it's possible, however I would not change TYPO3's default behavior.
Thanks for your understanding.

Yours Steffen
