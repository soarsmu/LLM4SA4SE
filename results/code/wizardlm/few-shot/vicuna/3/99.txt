A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Ack, yeah, that was my first way of fixing the original warning, but when I looked over the class more, I realised just removing the checks would be better... will fix.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: warn: lov_unpackmd():variable dereferenced before check 'lmm' (see line 392)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: The variable you should probably use here is U_BOOT_FDT_USE, defined in make.conf.

I agree the name is not great - we can change it if you like. But the intention is that this variable tells you which fdt to use, so there should be no need for this sort of logic in ebuilds.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Our convention here is to have URL like this:

/node/controller/reloadCertificate

ASSISTANT: non-negative
