A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: The include won't become redundant as the macros will still be needed. Instead the replicated Check{C,CXX}CompilerFlag.cmake will become redundant.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Here, we are making a bunch of datastore calls in a loop, which could fail (or time out) and drop half of the updates.

Since this is derived data and an async update is probably okay, a more robust approach would be to put tasks on the App Engine task queue to refresh each graph. Failed tasks automatically get retried.

The most robust way to do the update: given a graph id, regenerate the graph from a query of all its dependencies, sort of like a makefile. Then, since it's idempotent, it doesn't matter if it fails sometimes, and we can ignore concurrency as well since multiple writes don't matter.

(Incremental updates would be more efficient but trickier to get right, so I typically put that off until it seems necessary.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Be prepared that these logs won't show up. At least they don't on my Windows machine.

Seems like logs outside the test itself do not appear.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: We need refresh freq_demote = defrag->tier_demote_frequency; here, otherwise we won't be able to change the frequency from the CLI.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: this parameter doesnt currently exist in compat; I dont know why it is being introduced here.
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: There is no need for a "continue" here, since it means the same as the normal program flow...
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
