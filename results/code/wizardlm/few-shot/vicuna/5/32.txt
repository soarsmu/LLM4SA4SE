A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: It's either useless or not. If it's useless, remove.

(Note that we do not like transitive includes, though.)
Label: negative
Example Sentence: But you are already the NAT gateway (in 1) so no one else should be using gateway address?

Anyway I'm fine with -3 : please just add a comment to explain why it's -3 :)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Indeed, thanks.

I discovered this myself early last week, and addressed it in I82ff6602af3bf5 so that we use gcc 4.9.3 on slaves where that matters. Love these commercial-grade compilers!
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: what means "error_expected" = "create". It's means there are nor error? then it's better to use None by default for self.input.param("error-expected", None)

and you set string in error_expected by default value is boolean. python allows it but it's not good to change the type of variable
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Please don't do that. We manipulate DateTimeUtils.setCurrentMillisProvider to achieve what you want. Check ChangeEditIT for example: [1], Methods annotated with @Before and @After.
