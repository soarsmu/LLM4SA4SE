A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: This is nearly true. glusterd's connection management and NLM (gluster-nfs) uses @name different than THIS->name. I am removing @ctx from the argument list.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: (style)  cfs_list_add is deprecated, use list_add instead
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I'd prefer if sizeof(x) was used throughout, instead of sizeof(op_t). As a bonus, op_t would only occur once (in the variable declaration) and then the typedef could easily be removed.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Agreed. Unfortunately board-specific modifications to agesawrapper.c files have leaked in, making this a long boring process..
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/Documentation/dev-contributing.html#_tests
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: In the follow-up change [1] this method is renamed to 'canEditChangeLabels' [2]. I would propose to name it already here 'canEditChangeLabels' so that it doesn't need to be renamed in the next change.
