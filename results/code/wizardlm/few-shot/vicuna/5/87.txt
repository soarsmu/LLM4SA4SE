Example Sentence: It is my update of this help page:
https://help.libreoffice.org/Common/XML_File_Formats
It should also link to Expert Config page, but it does not exist yet.

Example Sentence: If a user term isn't returned I believe you'll get NPEs when displaying lists of changes. That's why I wrote https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/35201 so that this error is discovered early and is properly reported. I was a while since I looked at it, and the code might've changed since then, so don't take my word for it.

Example Sentence: Hi,
Correct me if i'm wrong - but, we have 2 instances of commands in the flow you described. This means they do not share state. The change done by Arik adds messages on the canDoActionMessages() collection of each one of the commands. Not sure how you're going to have this mix.
Label: negative
