A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: They could probably be combined, but the speed would be the same.  We still need to write the address out first before we can auto-increment. Let's leave that to later when/if it gets moved to the southbridge wrapper
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: it doesn't leave them; it always removes them.
"use specified directory for temporary files"
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: another note for future patch: replace static references by the proper Dao getter.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I want the next item to be dequeued when the previously dequeued item has been consumed by the caller (as there is no facility to enqueue an item again). So I am using the unbuffered channel for this synchronization.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: if defined ITK_HAS_TYPETRAITS_TR1_NAMESPACE
 define ITK_STD_TR1_NAMESPACE std::tr1
else
 define ITK_STD_TR1_NAMEPSACE std
endif
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I guess this must be an unsigned integer because of the way we shift bits in the next file. However, in that case the width too is likely important, and I would suggest using gmx_uint32_t for clarity.

ASSISTANT: non-negative
