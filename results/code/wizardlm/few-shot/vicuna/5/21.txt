A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: If a user term isn't returned I believe you'll get NPEs when displaying lists of changes. That's why I wrote https://gerrit-review.googlesource.com/35201 so that this error is discovered early and is properly reported. I was a while since I looked at it, and the code might've changed since then, so don't take my word for it.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I think this can be refactored (with the RTU "duplication") into the Modbus dissector.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: we can add at the end the following args "--" "-j8" but that won't work for windows.

Moreover we need to provide the generator. I was lucky enough that the system was picking the last one that I used.

So we might need to stick with a CMake call that configure the pom for you. So maybe for external build tree, that tree should probably became the place where maven should be run instead of the Maven source dir.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: "system-provided version" or "version provided by the system"
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Well I need a way to tell whether the newestConfiguration is enabled, since the 0 returned by defaultConfiguration() does not mean that, instead it means there are no configurations at all. How else do you suggest I could expose it?
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: Removed 'to' as the assertion is there for mostly documentation purposes.
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
