A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I do not understand... I am not trying to fix the world now...

all I need is to ask vdsm what is its id without having to deal with handling the /etc/vdsm/vdsm.id

are the above valid to this task?

the new code of vdsm-reg will call vdsm-tool vdsm-id --force and get id no matter if it is uuid or generated from anywhere else, this id is required for registration.

if you then want to improve how it is 'generated' you are welcome to do so, it will not break the interface.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Why did you make this change? I think it makes sense to have the assertion.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: warn: lov_unpackmd():variable dereferenced before check 'lmm' (see line 392)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: When you move a host to maintenance then that calls disconnectStorageServer which should remove this definition so in general this shouldn't affect anything negatively.  The case where this would remain is in case of an error flow where for some reason it wasn't disconnected properly or something.  Even if that happens, it's not that interesting as a few leftover connections shouldn't affect the host negatively (think about FC where the host is always connected).
The advantage is that most of the time (since hosts don't move between DCs very often) the host would automatically reconnect whenever it reboots (e.g. due to sanlock fencing) and it would be available to engine almost immediately reducing recovery time.  Imo that is more important.
See oVirt Bug 881941 - After a reboot of both engine and vdsm domains take a long time (15 minutes) to recover
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: In the latest patch, you switched from glib memory to wmem memory. So you do not want to call g_free but you still want to destroy the hash table itself, otherwise you are leaking memory. So switch to g_hash_table_new instead of g_hash_table_new_full and put back the call to g_hash_table_destroy.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: The Slerp I was thinking of, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp doesn't seem to be in all caps - is this something else? It does say somewhere to avoid acronyms but there are exceptions (this may be one of them).
