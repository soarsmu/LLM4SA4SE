A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: unused parameter 'p_info' [-Werror=unused-parameter]


(p_info ? -> pinfo ?)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: In my opinion a distinction needs to be drawn between IPv6 header bogus length and extension header bogus length. Whether all the different extension header should use the same expert_field or not for length is another issue, it's debatable but my current opinion is that they should be separate, i.e, ei_ipv6_routing_invalid_length, ei_ipv6_dstopts_invalid_length, etc. but if someone thinks differently please share.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Same here. Please, use empty lines instead of the ugly separators in this file. It is too compact and hard to read after your change.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I think the cleanest style here would be to make this:
class_linker->IsCompiledImageMethod(m)
and then embed MayBe... into ClassLinker as IsCompiledImageMethod. It'd be nice to avoid exposing the debugger to inner notions of oat files.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Unfortunately, I don't think so, since it probably contains the version of the metamodel which varies over time...
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: I agree if the file exist we should skip the conversion and print a information message
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
