Example Sentence: We would prefer to keep this.  It is possible for the RILD and radio code to pass the sequence number through into radio state as the request is being acted on - the RILD may notice the socket error and re-establish the connection and then the response comes back from the radio with the old sequence number and get's passed back through the newly-connected RILD.

Just because your implementation may not do this, we can imagine other OEMs passing back obsolete responses that would match a newly-zero'd RIL sequence number and confuse things.

Couldn't you just remember the first sequence number your RILD connection received?  Then you know the number of requests you've received.
