A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: There is no point in defining those private static variables, we could just use the string literal directly in the methods. It was like that originally because the original definitions were public static final's. We then switched to methods so that they could be overriden.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I agree that a trailing "or" is missing here (though defining a function is_configured and putting the grep's in it would have been better than any commenting. I cannot say that I like duplicating bash logic in English)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Element. This one stuck out. I think the only ones to try to capitalize are "Allocation, Type, Element", since that trio is the dominant set of APIs for interacting with any sort of data from Java.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: s/the//

Ã¢â‚¬Â¦ rebase the FSP with IntelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tool BCT.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: To address the previous concerns about constructing a massive QByteArray in the case of no terminating character: I set pos2 to pos so that the QByteArray is empty in that case.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: might as well drop the conditional and just assign it
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
