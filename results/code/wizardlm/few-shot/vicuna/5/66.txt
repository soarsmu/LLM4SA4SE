A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Please use logs instead of System.out.

You can add a log4j configuration to redirect to stdout if you want to see these printings.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: No it doesn't. We just have to parse repo-hooks childNodes after the project childNodes. Which you already do above. :-)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: there should be

  } else {
    rv = get_env_plugin_info(pi);

In this case the lcb_cntl user will get correct effective type
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: "Types" is an overloaded term in programming. Is it an actual term in the source documents, or can we use a different term here? Is "type" the same as "MIB"??
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: As every callback is only interested at the part starting at the token, what about using frame + offset here and dropping the p - frame in the callbacks?
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: If it's not set, there's no way to get FSP failure data out.  I agree that it's not an absolute requirement, but without it, if there's a failure, you're going to be pretty lost.

We could move it from here and put this below, surrounding the #if statements and not actually fail, but my opinion was this was the best option...
Label:
ASSISTANT: non-negative
