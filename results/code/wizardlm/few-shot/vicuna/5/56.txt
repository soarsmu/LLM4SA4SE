A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: You removed this line in I1c2a5a9c3da5 with a commit message that noted you wanted COM removal only in the second half of VV, but there was no related change to how that worked. How do we assess when you were right? :-D
Label: negative
Example Sentence: I assumed you didn't care about modifying the caller's array because "resources += srcs" modifies resources in-place as well. Yay Python. So you should fix that below.

Also typically in Python we strongly discourage mutable default arugments.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: The code in this library was generated by emugen and then manually modified ('vi' transformations) to match this library need. This code will be replaced with driver implementation.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: If we're trying to make this documentation more consistent with other module pages, then I assume this page is meant to be similar to http://qt-project.org/doc/qt-5.0/qtcore/qtcore-index.html in terms of listing the types provided by the module, so we should add a list here that link to the following types:

 * Component
 * QtObject
 * Binding
 * Connections
 * Timer

as these are the types provided by the QtQml module.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: I am sorry. I just missed it before. errno should already be set to ENOENT if resolve/lookup fails. We shouldn't map any other genuine errors to ENOENT.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: planning to do that in a separate changelist for MB-14866:
1. merge lock with seqno_list into the same structure
2. maintain a vbMap instead of vbList in this service, so as to make vbno lookup/validation faster
3. do vbno validation in all relevant places in the service

you mentioned that we could use list of list instead of map of list to avoid issues with map. Feel that it makes the code harder to read. we may have to understandard the behavior with maps anyway. Plan to make the changes above and see if the issue in MB-14866 re-cur.

ASSISTANT: non-negative
