A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: I don't want to change the actual messages in this change for reasons stated above.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: It probably is, but what happens when somebody upgrades the libvirt? Do we require vdsm restart as well? Or will it suddenly start working?
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Let's avoid having commented out code.  Delete the DCHECK (which looks wrong to me anyway - you certainly could have a const index, but backends are under no obligation to take advantage of that information.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Why not just adjust the check upstairs to 
(m->total_size?:2048) > (microcode_end - (u32)c)
then you won't need this check if you assume that cbfs is correct and if you don't cbfs check belongs to cbfs functions, not here.
Label: negative
Example Sentence: Please use double quotes for EGL/egldefs.h and log/log.h. These headers are now local. Same comment for other files including them.
Label: non-negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: oh, good catch! funny this slipped in ... btw: ArrayUtility from extbase should be reviewed and at first glance it seems most of it could be merged to core ArrayUtility.

ASSISTANT: positive
