A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant. The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.
USER: Please perform Sentiment Classification task. Given the sentence from code reviews, assign a sentiment label from ['negative', 'neutral', 'positive']. Return label only without any other text.
Example Sentence: Patch Set 2: Looks good to me, approved

I concur with jrbarnette@.  It sounds like we can do a separate issue/CL for removing the pragma.  To that end, I think a TODO() referring to that issue could be useful if added to this CL.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: (I think you could indent this line another four spaces if you want.)
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: You are right, this won't work without the next patch (use DbGroup instead of LdapGroup), I will check again and I will probably have to merge both this patch and next one into one single patch.
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Hi Robert,

I think this should be $newviewid not $viewid (as it's not defined at this point).

Thanks,
Ghada
Label: non-negative
Example Sentence: Don't encode the value right away.  Instead we should lazily encode the value only when the serialization stream needs it.  Thus the constructor is just:

  this.object = object;
  this.codec = codec;
  this.hash = object.hashCode();
Label: negative
ASSISTANT: Sure!</s>
USER: Sentence: (improvement) It should be possible to test this with only 2 OSTs.  With a two-stripe file it would be missing stripe index 0.
