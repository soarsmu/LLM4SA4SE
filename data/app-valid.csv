average no doubt the art work of the game is original and fits the environment well  but that alone does not make a good title. the gameplay is interesting but lacks a real reason to come back or be played over another game. the split screen in the only feature that stood out but even then it got boring quickly. i liked the game  thought it was promising  but a lack of ideas to keep me playing made the experience fall short.,2
best it's all right powerfull,1

gets the job done i was a handyshopper user and  although i miss being able to record aisles and prices for many stores for one item  i love that i can add something to the shopping list with my phone and my husband can see it immediately on his phone.  i also like that out of milk has a web site where i can build a list  so when i'm planning meals for the week  i can be building the list too using a regular keyboard.  i see the value of the pantry option.  i'll probably be using it to keep an inventory of our freeer and our spices.  i would like to see a way to add items to more than one list.  for example  i'd like chips to be on the costco list and the snack list so if i'm shopping at one store and see a great price  i'd know i needed chips.  overall  thisi app gets the job done and it's popularity makes me think the features i want may be added some day.,0

cutiest emoticons cute emoticons to have fun..,1
good app it's customizable which i like. sometimes it's a bit difficult getting items to line up properly and the areas for each part of the display don't change size dynamically so the font sizes will get bigger or smaller to fit in the space alloted for them which i don't like. overall it's a good app though.,1
