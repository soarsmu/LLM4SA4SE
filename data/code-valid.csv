Thanks for your reviews.

To be honest, it would be nice, if you could be a bit more friendly to - not first time in case of Thomas, but occasional - contributors. IMHO one or two -1 are enough for the beginning.

Bjrn and Philipp, you're really helpful contributors, thanks for that. We were discussing the ""patch for a patch rule"" over the last days, which we enjoined on ourselves as core team members some time ago (and it works in at least most of the cases I think).

But we repeat our-selves... and not progressing, so we can stop doing that... and progress... as whatever we have now is much better than whatever existed before.

When a user/downstream maintainer opens the service/unit/script whatever he expects to actually understand what happens there and why, and not start to dig within application to find issues and modify downstream specific logic.

At upstart of have the start/stop convention (yeah... you need something for legacy sysv, but simple if is doing the work), for systemd you need nothing as it handles the dependencies, for openrc you need nothing as it handles the dependencies.

So the discussion is entirely around the sysv scripts... I do remember that debian does have dependency management based on the header of scripts[1]

So we left with rhel only to handle...

This is why I do not understand why we need any common application downstream specific logic.
